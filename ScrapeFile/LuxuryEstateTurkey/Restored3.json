    "property_description": "<div><p class=\"whitespace-normal break-words\">When people talk about<a href=\"https://luxuryestateturkey.com/en/real-estate/turkey/alanya/luxury\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">luxury real estate in Alanya</a>, they usually mention square meters and amenities. But how do you put a price on the moment your shoulders drop and your breathing slows just because you stepped onto your terrace? That's the kind of luxury that doesn't show up in property listings &ndash; the luxury of coming home to peace- a kind of luxury that also qualifies you for<strong>Turkish citizenship.</strong></p><p class=\"whitespace-normal break-words\">Picture this: You wake up, pad barefoot to your kitchen, and while your coffee brews, you're looking out at the ancient Alanya Castle sitting proudly on its cliff, the endless blue sea stretching to the horizon, mountains rising like sleeping giants in the distance. This isn't a vacation moment you'll treasure forever &ndash; this is just Tuesday morning at your new sea view property in Alanya.</p><p class=\"whitespace-normal break-words\">But let's flip the script for a moment. Forget the morning coffee &ndash; let's talk about coming home after a long day. You pull into your private parking, take the elevator up to your sea view home in Alanya, and suddenly the stress of the day just melts away. Why?<strong>Because you're watching one of the most spectacular light shows on earth unfold right in front of you.</strong></p><p class=\"whitespace-normal break-words\">As the sun sets, Alanya Castle transforms from ancient stone to a glowing beacon, its lights reflecting off the water like scattered diamonds. You can see the little houses clustered around the castle hill starting to twinkle to life &ndash; windows lighting up one by one as families settle in for the evening, the warm glow of homes creating a constellation against the darkening hillside. And above it all, the moon begins its slow climb across the sky, casting silver paths across the water that seem to lead straight to your balcony.</p><p class=\"whitespace-normal break-words\"><strong>This isn't just a view you admire &ndash; it's therapy you live with every single evening.</strong></p><p>Standing proud on 600m&sup2; of carefully planned land, this 525m&sup2; architectural masterpiece rises through four thoughtfully designed floors. But calling it a house feels almost insulting to what it truly represents. This is your private resort, your wellness sanctuary, your entertainment hub, and your peaceful retreat all wrapped into one extraordinary address.</p><p>The moment you step inside, the distinction between indoor and outdoor living dissolves completely. Floor-to-ceiling glass walls don't just frame views &ndash; they invite the Mediterranean landscape to become part of your daily life. Dark and light grey stone cladding gives the exterior a sophisticated strength that commands respect, while the interior's palette of whites, creams, and soft greys creates an atmosphere that breathes tranquility into every corner.</p><h2>Villa Infinity brings you sea view in Alanya along with the benefit of Turkish citizenship eligibility</h2><p data-start=\"458\" data-end=\"749\">Here&rsquo;s where Villa Infinity transforms from a beautiful home into a life-changing investment. This property is fully eligible for the<a href=\"https://luxuryestateturkey.com/en/blog/types-of-passports-in-turkey-and-the-advantages-of-turkish-citizenship-in-2025\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Turkish Citizenship by Investment program</a>, giving you and your family the right to secure a new future in Turkey with all the privileges that come with it.</p><p data-start=\"751\" data-end=\"1216\">And Turkish citizenship means more than just holding a new passport. It offers security in a stable country, access to quality healthcare and education, and the chance to establish your life in a vibrant Mediterranean city. For investors, it creates a foundation for long-term returns, while for families it guarantees a safe and welcoming environment to call home. Villa Infinity is therefore not only a residence, but a direct path to a stronger and more certain future.</p><h2 class=\"text-xl font-bold text-text-100 mt-1 -mb-0.5\">Architectural Character &amp; Exterior</h2><p class=\"whitespace-normal break-words\">This striking villa makes a bold first impression with its sophisticated blend of dark and light grey stone cladding that creates a powerful, contemporary presence. The extensive use of floor-to-ceiling glass panels and sleek glass railings doesn't just bring a modern edge &ndash; it frames the surrounding landscape like a living artwork, making the views an integral part of the home's design story.</p><p class=\"whitespace-normal break-words\">The architectural language speaks of understated luxury, where every material choice has been carefully considered to create a sense of permanence and elegance that will age gracefully over time.</p><h2>Interior Palette &amp; Atmosphere</h2><p>Step inside, and you're immediately embraced by a carefully curated color story that feels both fresh and timeless. The interior palette revolves around crisp whites, warm creams, soft beiges, and sophisticated greys &ndash; a combination that breathes serenity into every corner while maintaining an air of refined elegance. This isn't just decoration; it's the foundation of a lifestyle that values calm sophistication over fleeting trends.</p><p>The overall effect is one of spacious tranquility, where natural light dances across neutral surfaces, creating an ever-changing canvas of subtle shadows and highlights throughout the day.</p><h2>Living &amp; Social Spaces</h2><p>The heart of the home showcases stunning white marble-effect flooring with clean, linear patterns that immediately evoke the luxury of a five-star hotel. But this isn't cold or intimidating &ndash; quite the opposite. The flooring serves as a beautiful backdrop for carefully selected furniture pieces that prioritize both comfort and contemporary style.</p><p>The seating areas feature plush, rounded-edge sofas and chairs with soft textures that invite you to sink in and stay awhile. These aren't just beautiful pieces &ndash; they're designed for real living, real conversations, real moments with family and friends.</p><p>Above, dramatic spherical pendant lights and strategically placed LED recessed lighting create layers of illumination that can shift the mood from bright and energizing during the day to intimate and cozy in the evening. The lighting design doesn't just illuminate spaces; it sculpts them, adding depth and drama to every gathering.</p><h2>Dining &amp; Kitchen Experience</h2><p>The dining area centers around an elegant oval white table surrounded by minimalist chairs that capture the essence of Scandinavian modern design &ndash; clean, functional, and effortlessly stylish. This isn't formal dining that intimidates; it's a space that welcomes both intimate family meals and larger gatherings with equal grace.</p><p>The kitchen island and accompanying bar stools transform cooking from a chore into a social experience. Whether you're preparing a quiet breakfast or hosting a dinner party, the design encourages interaction and connection. The thoughtful integration of warm wood cladding against the predominantly white surfaces adds just the right amount of natural warmth, preventing the space from feeling stark or cold.</p><p>This is a kitchen designed for real life &ndash; beautiful enough for entertaining, practical enough for everyday living.</p><h2>Private Retreats</h2><p>The bedrooms continue the hotel-inspired luxury theme, with carefully selected headboards and linens that create an immediate sense of refined comfort. These aren't just places to sleep &ndash; they're personal sanctuaries designed for true rest and rejuvenation.</p><p>The master suite takes luxury to the next level with a bathtub elegantly integrated into the bedroom space itself. This bold design choice creates an immediate spa-like atmosphere, blurring the lines between sleeping, bathing, and relaxation into one seamless experience of personal indulgence.</p><h2>Wellness &amp; Mindfulness</h2><p>Perhaps most uniquely, the villa features a dedicated wellness room that serves as a yoga and meditation sanctuary. Large mirrors amplify the natural light and sense of space, while a golden-toned Buddha statue provides a focal point for contemplation. The abundance of natural light streaming through oversized windows creates an authentic \"zen\" atmosphere that supports both physical practice and mental clarity.</p><p><em>This villa in Alanya represents more than just luxury living &ndash; it's a thoughtfully designed environment that supports both social connection and personal well-being, where every detail has been considered to create a home that's as beautiful as it is livable.</em></p><h2 data-start=\"5572\" data-end=\"5608\">Outdoor Living with a Hawaiian Spirit</h2><p data-start=\"5610\" data-end=\"5664\">Step outside, and the property continues to impress.</p><ul data-start=\"5666\" data-end=\"6375\"><li data-start=\"5666\" data-end=\"5830\"><p data-start=\"5668\" data-end=\"5830\"><strong data-start=\"5668\" data-end=\"5685\">Infinity Pool</strong>&ndash; Positioned to capture the full panorama of the Mediterranean and Alanya Castle, with glass barriers ensuring the view remains uninterrupted.</p></li><li data-start=\"5831\" data-end=\"5988\"><p data-start=\"5833\" data-end=\"5988\"><strong data-start=\"5833\" data-end=\"5850\">Garden Design</strong>&ndash; Inspired by tropical aesthetics, it combines palm trees, bright flowers, and lush greenery to create a feeling reminiscent of Hawaii.</p></li><li data-start=\"6251\" data-end=\"6375\"><p data-start=\"6253\" data-end=\"6375\"><strong data-start=\"6253\" data-end=\"6279\">Outdoor Shower for Two</strong>&ndash; A detail that blends practicality with indulgence, adding to the villa&rsquo;s spa-like identity.</p></li></ul><p data-start=\"6377\" data-end=\"6518\">Every inch of outdoor space is crafted to extend living beyond the villa&rsquo;s walls, ensuring both relaxation and activity are always at hand.</p><h2 data-start=\"5572\" data-end=\"5608\">Outdoors with a Hawaiian Spirit</h2><p data-start=\"5610\" data-end=\"5664\">Step outside, and the property continues to impress.</p><ul data-start=\"5666\" data-end=\"6375\"><li data-start=\"5666\" data-end=\"5830\"><p data-start=\"5668\" data-end=\"5830\"><strong data-start=\"5668\" data-end=\"5685\">Infinity Pool</strong>&ndash; Positioned to capture the full panorama of the Mediterranean and Alanya Castle, with glass barriers ensuring the view remains uninterrupted.</p></li><li data-start=\"5831\" data-end=\"5988\"><p data-start=\"5833\" data-end=\"5988\"><strong data-start=\"5833\" data-end=\"5850\">Garden Design</strong>&ndash; Inspired by tropical aesthetics, it combines palm trees, bright flowers, and lush greenery to create a feeling reminiscent of Hawaii.</p></li><li data-start=\"5989\" data-end=\"6136\"><p data-start=\"5991\" data-end=\"6136\"><strong data-start=\"5991\" data-end=\"6023\">Pavilion and Outdoor Kitchen</strong>&ndash; A fully equipped space for summer evenings, complete with fireplace for gatherings that last into the night.</p></li><li data-start=\"6137\" data-end=\"6250\"><p data-start=\"6139\" data-end=\"6250\"><strong data-start=\"6139\" data-end=\"6160\">Sports Facilities</strong>&ndash; A private badminton and floorball court brings recreation literally to your doorstep.</p></li><li data-start=\"6251\" data-end=\"6375\"><p data-start=\"6253\" data-end=\"6375\"><strong data-start=\"6253\" data-end=\"6279\">Outdoor Shower for Two</strong>&ndash; A detail that blends practicality with indulgence, adding to the villa&rsquo;s spa-like identity.</p></li></ul><p data-start=\"6377\" data-end=\"6518\">&nbsp;</p><p data-start=\"6377\" data-end=\"6518\">Every inch of outdoor space is crafted to extend living beyond the villa&rsquo;s walls, ensuring both relaxation and activity are always at hand.</p><h2 data-start=\"8763\" data-end=\"8823\">Luxury Estate Turkey &ndash; Your Partner in Exclusive Living</h2><p data-start=\"8825\" data-end=\"9035\">At Luxury Estate Turkey, we know that purchasing a property like Villa Infinity is about more than square meters and features.

    "property_title": "Massive Villa in Alanya Offers You 1000 m² of Living Freedom",
    "property_description": "<div><p data-start=\"319\" data-end=\"784\">You are in Alanya, a city that greets you with more than 300 days of sunshine every year. This<a href=\"https://luxuryestateturkey.com/en/real-estate/turkey/alanya/villas\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">villa for sale in alanya</a>rises on a commanding 1000 m&sup2; land plot and unfolds into eight expansive rooms in a rare 6+2 layout&mdash;a format that perfectly blends multiple living areas with private retreats (you might have heard about the<a href=\"https://luxuryestateturkey.com/en/blog/what-does-1-1-or-2-1-mean-in-turkey-guide-to-turkish-apartment-types-and-layouts\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Turkish<em data-start=\"633\" data-end=\"648\">&ldquo;plus system&rdquo;</em>,</a>and yes, this is one of those homes where it matters). &nbsp;</p><p data-start=\"319\" data-end=\"784\">It&rsquo;s not just a villa&mdash;it&rsquo;s the kind of place that reminds you of hillside residences in Spain or villas on the French coast, yet it feels completely at home here in Turkey.</p><p data-start=\"786\" data-end=\"1107\">The moment you walk inside, the quality speaks for itself: marble floors that shine, wide glass panels that flood the rooms with light, and private wellness touches like a sauna and jacuzzi.</p><p data-start=\"786\" data-end=\"1107\">Outside, the terraces stretch toward the castle, the mountains, and the sea, giving you the kind of view you never get tired of.</p><p data-start=\"1109\" data-end=\"1330\">And even with all this privacy, you&rsquo;re still only 4 km from the shoreline and just a short drive from the city center. Close enough for daily life, but far enough to feel like you&rsquo;ve stepped into your own private world.</p><h2>Inside this villa in Alanya: Everyday Life with Hotel Comforts</h2><h3>Prestige in Every Step</h3><p>The villa is finished throughout with polished marble floors. They don&rsquo;t just brighten the rooms, they also give that immediate sense of quality the moment you step in. It&rsquo;s a surface that feels solid underfoot and instantly sets the tone for the whole house.</p><h3>A Living Room Made for Arrival</h3><p>The main salon looks like it could belong to a boutique hotel. Grey sectional sofas fill the space comfortably, with subtle gold details adding a touch of shine. Deep blue armchairs break the monotony and bring a richer atmosphere. It&rsquo;s not a room that feels &ldquo;decorated&rdquo;&mdash;it feels like it was put together with intention. You don&rsquo;t just enter the living room, you arrive into it.</p><h3>Lighting that Works with Mood</h3><p>Recessed spotlights and slim wall lamps create layers of light. In the evening, the house doesn&rsquo;t just get brighter&mdash;it softens into a warm glow. The design is minimal, but never cold. It gives the house the kind of mood you&rsquo;d expect from a high-end city hotel, only this time there&rsquo;s no checkout desk waiting for you.</p><h3>Stairs with Character</h3><p>The staircase, framed in glass, isn&rsquo;t hidden away. It stands as a central piece that visually connects the levels. Rather than being just functional, it works like part of the architecture, reminding you that<strong>every corner of this villa in Alanya was considered.</strong></p><h3>Bedrooms that Open to the View</h3><p>Each bedroom uses wide glass panels to keep the scenery in front of you. The furniture is kept deliberately neutral so nothing competes with the outside. From the bed you see the city, the castle, and the sea. It&rsquo;s the kind of view that makes you close your eyes at night with the skyline still on your mind.</p><h3>Bathrooms Made for More Than Routine</h3><p>The bathrooms go well beyond being practical. One holds a jacuzzi facing the horizon, another includes a sauna finished in natural wood. They&rsquo;re not designed just for daily routines&mdash;they&rsquo;re spaces for slowing down, unwinding, and giving yourself time, almost like having a private spa inside your own home.</p><h2 data-start=\"3167\" data-end=\"3218\">Outdoor Spaces in this villa in Alanya made for Living, Not Just Looking!</h2><p data-start=\"3220\" data-end=\"3554\">Step outside, and the villa&rsquo;s panoramic terrace stretches wide enough to host a dinner for twenty<strong>without anyone feeling squeezed.</strong></p><p data-start=\"3220\" data-end=\"3554\">The private pool sits in front, lined with glass to protect the view of the sea and Alanya Castle.</p><p data-start=\"3220\" data-end=\"3554\">A landscaped garden adds greenery, softening the grand stone and marble touches with a natural rhythm.</p><p data-start=\"269\" data-end=\"730\">There&rsquo;s space here not just for sunbeds, but for a way of living.

    "property_title": "Panoramic Sea View Villa in Alanya with Infinity Pool",
    "property_description": "<div><p data-start=\"370\" data-end=\"949\">There are homes that you walk into and simply know they were designed to impress. This villa in Kargıcak is one of them. Set high above the coastline, with uninterrupted views over the Mediterranean, Alanya Castle, and the Taurus Mountains, it feels like a private retreat suspended between sea and sky. Every corner of the property radiates elegance: the infinity pool glitters in the sunlight, terraces stretch outward for endless evenings with friends, and the interiors reveal marble floors, sleek lighting, and vast glass surfaces that let the landscape flow right inside.</p><p data-start=\"951\" data-end=\"1578\">Unlike a standard villa for sale in Alanya, this property tells a story of modern luxury shaped for both comfort and status. It was completed in 2024 with cutting-edge materials, full underfloor heating, and smart-home technology. Consequently, you don&rsquo;t just live here &mdash; you control the atmosphere with a touch, you host with ease, and you wake every day to panoramas that remind you why people call the Mediterranean lifestyle priceless. Moreover, because the property qualifies for Turkish citizenship, it holds not only emotional but also strategic value for international buyers seeking a long-term connection to Turkey.</p><h2 data-start=\"1580\" data-end=\"1630\">Architectural character and first impressions</h2><p data-start=\"1632\" data-end=\"2022\">This luxury villa in Turkey does not hide its ambition. From the moment you approach the gated entrance, the geometry of the building signals confidence: clean lines, generous terraces, and a south&ndash;east&ndash;west orientation that maximizes sunlight and view corridors. The 520 m&sup2; plot allows the villa to breathe; garden spaces surround the pool while wide balconies extend each floor outward.</p><p data-start=\"2024\" data-end=\"2331\">Glass dominates the fa&ccedil;ade, yet stone and warm textures ground the design. The infinity pool merges visually with the horizon, producing that magical effect of swimming directly into the Mediterranean. During the day, the water reflects blue skies; at sunset, it becomes a mirror of the glowing coastline.</p><p data-start=\"2333\" data-end=\"2664\">Inside, the open-plan living areas use marble flooring and recessed lighting to create a cool, airy feel. High ceilings and large surfaces of glass encourage the landscape to become part of the d&eacute;cor. Meanwhile, smart-home integration makes daily living effortless: lighting, heating, and even security respond to remote control.</p><h2 data-start=\"2666\" data-end=\"2721\">Interior layout &mdash; 5 rooms designed for modern life</h2><p data-start=\"2723\" data-end=\"2896\">At 285 m&sup2; net, the villa&rsquo;s interior ensures comfort for every family member. Five spacious rooms can adapt to different needs: bedrooms, guest suites, or a private office.</p><ul data-start=\"2898\" data-end=\"3877\"><li data-start=\"2898\" data-end=\"3115\"><p data-start=\"2900\" data-end=\"3115\"><strong data-start=\"2900\" data-end=\"2916\">Living area:</strong>A bright open space connected to the terrace. Floor-to-ceiling windows frame the sea and castle views. The flow between indoor lounge and outdoor sitting areas keeps life connected to the climate.</p></li><li data-start=\"3116\" data-end=\"3382\"><p data-start=\"3118\" data-end=\"3382\"><strong data-start=\"3118\" data-end=\"3141\">Kitchen and dining:</strong>Designed for both everyday meals and social evenings. The layout supports white goods, ample storage, and a central island. Moreover, the dining zone benefits from sliding doors that open to the terrace, so meals naturally spill outdoors.</p></li><li data-start=\"3383\" data-end=\"3573\"><p data-start=\"3385\" data-end=\"3573\"><strong data-start=\"3385\" data-end=\"3398\">Bedrooms:</strong>Each room offers space for rest with access to views. The master suite includes a dressing room, modern en-suite bathroom, and a balcony overlooking both sea and mountains.</p></li><li data-start=\"3574\" data-end=\"3736\"><p data-start=\"3576\" data-end=\"3736\"><strong data-start=\"3576\" data-end=\"3590\">Bathrooms:</strong>Multiple units finished with marble and modern fittings. Private Turkish bath and sauna facilities transform the villa into a wellness retreat.</p></li><li data-start=\"3737\" data-end=\"3877\"><p data-start=\"3739\" data-end=\"3877\"><strong data-start=\"3739\" data-end=\"3755\">Flexibility:</strong>One of the five rooms easily becomes a study, gym, or media room. As a result, the villa adapts to changing lifestyles.</p></li></ul><h2 data-start=\"3879\" data-end=\"3932\">Wellness and leisure &mdash; private luxury facilities</h2><p data-start=\"3934\" data-end=\"4279\">This villa transforms daily living into a resort experience. Beyond the infinity pool, you enjoy a private Turkish bath, sauna, and even a mini bar near the outdoor sitting areas. The flow of space encourages relaxation: after a swim, you pass directly to the terrace for drinks, or step into the sauna before cooling down under the night sky.</p><p data-start=\"4281\" data-end=\"4531\">Barbecue areas, shaded sitting corners, and open terraces provide variety for gatherings. Children&rsquo;s pool sections make family life easier, while adults appreciate the calm of the infinity edge. Consequently, every generation finds its rhythm here.</p><h2 data-start=\"4533\" data-end=\"4566\">Smart technology and comfort</h2><ul data-start=\"4568\" data-end=\"4907\"><li data-start=\"4568\" data-end=\"4650\"><p data-start=\"4570\" data-end=\"4650\">Full<strong data-start=\"4575\" data-end=\"4604\">underfloor heating system</strong>across all rooms, ideal for year-round use.</p></li><li data-start=\"4651\" data-end=\"4729\"><p data-start=\"4653\" data-end=\"4729\"><strong data-start=\"4653\" data-end=\"4674\">Smart home system</strong>with remote control, enhancing security and comfort.</p></li><li data-start=\"4730\" data-end=\"4798\"><p data-start=\"4732\" data-end=\"4798\"><strong data-start=\"4732\" data-end=\"4756\">24/7 camera security</strong>integrated with the caretaker presence.</p></li><li data-start=\"4799\" data-end=\"4862\"><p data-start=\"4801\" data-end=\"4862\"><strong data-start=\"4801\" data-end=\"4827\">Electric water heating</strong>and modern white goods included.</p></li><li data-start=\"4863\" data-end=\"4907\"><p data-start=\"4865\" data-end=\"4907\"><strong data-start=\"4865\" data-end=\"4878\">Generator</strong>for uninterrupted service.</p></li></ul><p data-start=\"4909\" data-end=\"5080\">Because the property is brand new (built in 2024), all systems meet current standards. Maintenance worries remain low, and energy efficiency supports sustainable living.</p><h2 data-start=\"5082\" data-end=\"5121\">Location &mdash; why Kargıcak stands out</h2><p data-start=\"5123\" data-end=\"5446\">Kargıcak has become one of Alanya&rsquo;s most prestigious residential zones. Perched on rising terrain east of the city center, it offers panoramic views that few neighborhoods can match. The atmosphere is quieter than central Alanya, yet you remain within comfortable reach of the city&rsquo;s beaches, shopping, and cultural life.</p><ul data-start=\"5448\" data-end=\"5899\"><li data-start=\"5448\" data-end=\"5547\"><p data-start=\"5450\" data-end=\"5547\"><strong data-start=\"5450\" data-end=\"5470\">Distance to sea:</strong>2.5 km &mdash; close enough for daily swims, yet high enough for dramatic views.</p></li><li data-start=\"5548\" data-end=\"5672\"><p data-start=\"5550\" data-end=\"5672\"><strong data-start=\"5550\" data-end=\"5561\">Access:</strong>Easy roads connect Kargıcak to Alanya center (about 15 minutes) and to Gazipaşa Airport (around 25 minutes).</p></li><li data-start=\"5673\" data-end=\"5899\"><p data-start=\"5675\" data-end=\"5899\"><strong data-start=\"5675\" data-end=\"5692\">Surroundings:</strong>Vineyards, pine forests, and villa estates shape the landscape. International residents have established a strong community here, while local services like markets and restaurants keep routines practical.</p></li></ul><p data-start=\"5901\" data-end=\"6030\">Consequently, Kargıcak balances exclusivity with accessibility. You live above the bustle, yet not cut off from everyday needs.</p><h2 data-start=\"6032\" data-end=\"6073\">Investment and citizenship potential</h2><p data-start=\"6075\" data-end=\"6419\">For foreign investors, this villa represents more than a lifestyle purchase. Because of its value and legal status, it qualifies directly for<strong data-start=\"6217\" data-end=\"6240\">Turkish citizenship</strong>through investment. This adds a strategic layer: not only do you secure a luxury villa in Turkey, but you also gain the right to live, work, and travel with a Turkish passport.</p><p data-start=\"6421\" data-end=\"6827\">From an investment angle, the villa&rsquo;s combination of location, facilities, and design ensures strong future resale value. Demand for sea view villa in Turkey continues to grow, especially among families and entrepreneurs from Europe, the Middle East, and CIS countries. Rental potential also exists for short-term luxury holiday lettings, given the infinity pool, spa facilities, and smart-home features.</p><h2 data-start=\"6829\" data-end=\"6883\">Styling inspiration &mdash; blending modern with warmth</h2><p data-start=\"6885\" data-end=\"7016\">Although the villa arrives fully equipped with white goods and high-quality finishes, interior styling allows you to personalize:</p><ul data-start=\"7018\" data-end=\"7417\"><li data-start=\"7018\" data-end=\"7153\"><p data-start=\"7020\" data-end=\"7153\"><strong data-start=\"7020\" data-end=\"7037\">Living areas:</strong>Low, modular sofas in natural fabrics keep the focus on views. Add textured rugs for warmth and acoustic comfort.</p></li><li data-start=\"7154\" data-end=\"7271\"><p data-start=\"7156\" data-end=\"7271\"><strong data-start=\"7156\" data-end=\"7169\">Bedrooms:</strong>Minimalist wardrobes and light color schemes emphasize calm. Wooden accents soften marble flooring.</p></li><li data-start=\"7272\" data-end=\"7417\"><p data-start=\"7274\" data-end=\"7417\"><strong data-start=\"7274\" data-end=\"7295\">Outdoor terraces:</strong>Rattan or teak furniture with neutral cushions echo the Mediterranean feel. Lantern lighting extends use into evenings.</p></li></ul><p data-start=\"7419\" data-end=\"7519\">These choices maintain the villa&rsquo;s modern identity while ensuring a welcoming, livable atmosphere.</p><h2 data-start=\"7521\" data-end=\"7551\">Who this villa suits best</h2><ul data-start=\"7553\" data-end=\"8035\"><li data-start=\"7553\" data-end=\"7681\"><p data-start=\"7555\" data-end=\"7681\"><strong data-start=\"7555\" data-end=\"7598\">Families seeking a permanent residence:</strong>Space, private facilities, and schooling access make year-round living feasible.</p></li><li data-start=\"7682\" data-end=\"7797\"><p data-start=\"7684\" data-end=\"7797\"><strong data-start=\"7684\" data-end=\"7712\">International investors:</strong>Turkish citizenship eligibility, strong rental prospects, and stable value growth.</p></li><li data-start=\"7798\" data-end=\"7917\"><p data-start=\"7800\" data-end=\"7917\"><strong data-start=\"7800\" data-end=\"7829\">Luxury lifestyle seekers:</strong>Buyers who value infinity pools, private wellness facilities, and panoramic terraces.</p></li><li data-start=\"7918\" data-end=\"8035\"><p data-start=\"7920\" data-end=\"8035\"><strong data-start=\"7920\" data-end=\"7956\">Professionals and entrepreneurs:</strong>Those wanting a prestige property that doubles as a retreat and a statement.</p></li></ul><h2 data-start=\"8037\" data-end=\"8076\">Why work with Luxury Estate Turkey</h2><p data-start=\"8078\" data-end=\"8193\">Buying a luxury villa in Turkey is both exciting and complex.

It is one of Alanya&rsquo;s most developed and expat-friendly districts, with a large international community that gives it a cosmopolitan yet relaxed atmosphere.</p><p>The district stretches for several kilometers, meaning you can find both lively areas with caf&eacute;s, shops, and restaurants, as well as quieter zones closer to the mountains. Only 10 km from Alanya city center, Mahmutlar allows residents to enjoy peaceful daily life while remaining close to the vibrant social and commercial heart of Alanya.</p><h3>Lifestyle Advantages in Mahmutlar</h3><ul><li><p><strong>Beaches and Water Sports:</strong>Mahmutlar&rsquo;s coastline offers sandy beaches perfect for swimming, sunbathing, and water sports.

    "property_title": "Sea View Summer Bliss Villa in Alanya with Private Pool",
    "property_description": "<div><p>There are homes that already win you over before you open the door. Summer Bliss Villa in Alanya is one of them. The front view blends bright white walls with natural wood, giving off an elegant yet welcoming vibe. And just beyond, the pool stretches across a wide terrace with places to sit back or soak up the sun. It looks like a holiday in Turkey, only it&rsquo;s yours to enjoy every single day.</p><p>This triplex villa stretches across 471 m&sup2; of interior and 135 m&sup2; of terraces, sitting on a<strong>550 m&sup2; plot.</strong>With 4 bedrooms, 2 large salons, 5 bathrooms, and even 2 dressing rooms, it offers volume and scale rarely seen in the Alanya property market.</p><p>The sea view villa is only 2 years old, which means every detail, from the smart home system to the underfloor heating, works flawlessly. Add a private pool, landscaped garden, private parking with elevator access directly into the house, and you realize this is not simply a house &mdash;<strong>it is a statement.</strong></p><h2 data-start=\"1941\" data-end=\"1998\">Spacious interiors &mdash; high ceilings and modern design</h2><p data-start=\"2000\" data-end=\"2273\">The villa&rsquo;s interior combines modern luxury with art deco touches. High ceilings amplify natural light, while white marble-effect floors keep the rooms bright and cool. Hidden LED lighting enhances the sense of space, creating a glow that shifts gently from day to night.</p><h3 data-start=\"2275\" data-end=\"2293\">Living rooms</h3><p data-start=\"2295\" data-end=\"2741\">The main salon carries a modern-classic aesthetic: wide sofas in neutral tones, contrasted with black and white furniture pieces. A central coffee table with gold detailing introduces art deco flair, while the overall balance remains elegant rather than overwhelming. The second salon adds flexibility, either as a family lounge or entertainment area. Because of the villa&rsquo;s scale, these spaces never feel crowded, even when hosting gatherings.</p><h3 data-start=\"2743\" data-end=\"2756\">Kitchen</h3><p data-start=\"2758\" data-end=\"3164\">The kitchen takes a bold stance with a black marble countertop, glossy cabinets, and a round window that sets the scene apart from standard designs. Minimalism meets functionality &mdash; appliances integrate smoothly, surfaces remain easy to clean, and the layout allows more than one person to cook at once. For many buyers who value both aesthetics and practical use, this kitchen will be a clear highlight.</p><h3 data-start=\"3166\" data-end=\"3180\">Bedrooms</h3><ul data-start=\"3182\" data-end=\"3712\"><li data-start=\"3182\" data-end=\"3409\"><p data-start=\"3184\" data-end=\"3409\"><strong data-start=\"3184\" data-end=\"3216\">Green-themed master bedroom:</strong>Velvet textures, patterned textiles, and gold accents deliver an art deco mood. The palette is daring but sophisticated, ideal for someone who wants a strong identity in their private space.</p></li><li data-start=\"3410\" data-end=\"3588\"><p data-start=\"3412\" data-end=\"3588\"><strong data-start=\"3412\" data-end=\"3437\">Navy-themed bedrooms:</strong>Masculine, structured, and modern-classic. Large windows emphasize the partial sea and mountain views. Curtains balance light control with softness.</p></li><li data-start=\"3589\" data-end=\"3712\"><p data-start=\"3591\" data-end=\"3712\"><strong data-start=\"3591\" data-end=\"3617\">Single-bed guest room:</strong>Simple, functional, and versatile. Perfect for teenagers, visiting friends, or a study room.</p></li></ul><p data-start=\"3714\" data-end=\"3832\">Two dressing rooms add convenience, letting residents organize clothing and accessories without cluttering bedrooms.</p><h3 data-start=\"3834\" data-end=\"3849\">Bathrooms</h3><p data-start=\"3851\" data-end=\"4105\">Five bathrooms across three floors ensure no morning rush becomes stressful. Each one uses modern ceramics, quality fixtures, and a clean design language. Heated floors keep winters comfortable, while generous mirrors and lighting enhance practicality.</p><h2 data-start=\"4107\" data-end=\"4158\">Outdoor lifestyle &mdash; pool, terraces, and garden</h2><p data-start=\"4160\" data-end=\"4253\">Outdoor living is central to the Mediterranean lifestyle, and this villa delivers it fully.</p><ul data-start=\"4255\" data-end=\"4920\"><li data-start=\"4255\" data-end=\"4364\"><p data-start=\"4257\" data-end=\"4364\"><strong data-start=\"4257\" data-end=\"4283\">Private swimming pool:</strong>Framed by a wide terrace, ideal for laps in the morning or evening gatherings.</p></li><li data-start=\"4365\" data-end=\"4538\"><p data-start=\"4367\" data-end=\"4538\"><strong data-start=\"4367\" data-end=\"4387\">135 m&sup2; terraces:</strong>With glass railings that preserve panoramic views, they open possibilities for outdoor dining, lounge corners, or minimalist furniture arrangements.</p></li><li data-start=\"4539\" data-end=\"4637\"><p data-start=\"4541\" data-end=\"4637\"><strong data-start=\"4541\" data-end=\"4572\">Barbecue and seating areas:</strong>Built-in functionality for summer dinners and social evenings.</p></li><li data-start=\"4638\" data-end=\"4769\"><p data-start=\"4640\" data-end=\"4769\"><strong data-start=\"4640\" data-end=\"4662\">Landscaped garden:</strong>Automatic irrigation keeps the greenery fresh. Palm trees and shrubs add privacy and a natural backdrop.</p></li><li data-start=\"4770\" data-end=\"4920\"><p data-start=\"4772\" data-end=\"4920\"><strong data-start=\"4772\" data-end=\"4810\">Private parking and direct access:</strong>The parking garage leads directly into the villa with elevator access, a rare convenience in Alanya villas.</p></li></ul><p data-start=\"4922\" data-end=\"5156\">In total, the outdoor spaces create a resort-like atmosphere, but you remain in full control of how you use them. Some owners will emphasize social dinners; others will prefer tranquil mornings with coffee overlooking the mountains.</p><h2 data-start=\"5158\" data-end=\"5206\">Technical highlights that guarantee comfort</h2><ul data-start=\"5208\" data-end=\"5635\"><li data-start=\"5208\" data-end=\"5277\"><p data-start=\"5210\" data-end=\"5277\"><strong data-start=\"5210\" data-end=\"5231\">Smart home system</strong>for lighting, security, and climate control</p></li><li data-start=\"5278\" data-end=\"5323\"><p data-start=\"5280\" data-end=\"5323\"><strong data-start=\"5280\" data-end=\"5302\">Underfloor heating</strong>for winter comfort</p></li><li data-start=\"5324\" data-end=\"5371\"><p data-start=\"5326\" data-end=\"5371\"><strong data-start=\"5326\" data-end=\"5339\">Generator</strong>to avoid energy interruptions</p></li><li data-start=\"5372\" data-end=\"5439\"><p data-start=\"5374\" data-end=\"5439\"><strong data-start=\"5374\" data-end=\"5407\">Water tank and booster system</strong>for consistent water pressure</p></li><li data-start=\"5440\" data-end=\"5475\"><p data-start=\"5442\" data-end=\"5475\"><strong data-start=\"5442\" data-end=\"5473\">24/7 camera security system</strong></p></li><li data-start=\"5476\" data-end=\"5513\"><p data-start=\"5478\" data-end=\"5513\"><strong data-start=\"5478\" data-end=\"5499\">Caretaker service</strong>in the area</p></li><li data-start=\"5514\" data-end=\"5556\"><p data-start=\"5516\" data-end=\"5556\"><strong data-start=\"5516\" data-end=\"5542\">Cable TV and satellite</strong>connections</p></li><li data-start=\"5557\" data-end=\"5635\"><p data-start=\"5559\" data-end=\"5635\"><strong data-start=\"5559\" data-end=\"5597\">Furniture and white goods included</strong>, all high-quality and ready for use</p></li></ul><p data-start=\"5637\" data-end=\"5824\">These features set the property apart from many other<strong data-start=\"5691\" data-end=\"5720\">sea view villas in Alanya</strong>, where such infrastructure is often optional or absent. Here, everything has already been considered.</p><h2 data-start=\"5826\" data-end=\"5870\">Location &mdash; why Kargicak is so appealing?</h2><p data-start=\"5872\" data-end=\"6283\">Kargıcak lies about 15 minutes from Alanya&rsquo;s center. It is quieter than Mahmutlar or Oba, yet it offers good infrastructure: supermarkets, cafes, restaurants, and local services all sit nearby. The villa stands only 3 km from the beach, which means you reach the Mediterranean in a short drive or even a long walk. The area attracts international residents who prefer spacious homes and tranquil surroundings.</p><p data-start=\"6285\" data-end=\"6658\">Moreover, Kargıcak&rsquo;s hills provide natural advantages. Views sweep across greenery, with glimpses of the sea in the distance. Air feels fresher than in denser urban zones, and the roads remain less congested. Investors recognize the stability of this neighborhood: villas here retain value because the land supply is limited, and demand from foreigners continues to rise.</p><h2 data-start=\"6660\" data-end=\"6699\">Investment and lifestyle potential</h2><p data-start=\"6701\" data-end=\"6778\">From an investment standpoint, Summer Bliss Villa holds multiple strengths:</p><ul data-start=\"6780\" data-end=\"7295\"><li data-start=\"6780\" data-end=\"6928\"><p data-start=\"6782\" data-end=\"6928\"><strong data-start=\"6782\" data-end=\"6800\">Rental demand:</strong>High among families and groups searching for luxury villa rentals in Turkey, particularly those who prioritize private pools.</p></li><li data-start=\"6929\" data-end=\"7031\"><p data-start=\"6931\" data-end=\"7031\"><strong data-start=\"6931\" data-end=\"6952\">Resale potential:</strong>As a nearly new villa with strong features, it will retain appeal for years.</p></li><li data-start=\"7032\" data-end=\"7122\"><p data-start=\"7034\" data-end=\"7122\"><strong data-start=\"7034\" data-end=\"7060\">Cash payment discount:</strong>Available options make the purchase financially attractive.</p></li><li data-start=\"7123\" data-end=\"7295\"><p data-start=\"7125\" data-end=\"7295\"><strong data-start=\"7125\" data-end=\"7176\">Residence permit and citizenship opportunities:</strong>For international buyers, this property can form part of the required portfolio, depending on investment thresholds.</p></li></ul><p data-start=\"7297\" data-end=\"7534\">Lifestyle-wise, the villa offers independence and comfort. Families enjoy multiple bedrooms, outdoor play areas, and a secure environment. Retirees find calmness combined with convenience. Investors gain both yield and future security.</p><h2 data-start=\"141\" data-end=\"493\"><strong data-start=\"495\" data-end=\"519\">Who this villa suits</strong></h2><p data-start=\"141\" data-end=\"493\">When you contact<strong data-start=\"158\" data-end=\"182\">Luxury Estate Turkey</strong>, our first priority is always to match you with the property that truly fits your lifestyle and expectations.

Recognized as one of Alanya&rsquo;s most complete developments, it blends the privileges of a five-star hotel with the privacy of your own home. This is not just another<a href=\"https://luxuryestateturkey.com/en/real-estate/turkey/alanya/luxury\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><strong data-start=\"518\" data-end=\"557\">luxury apartment for sale in Alanya</strong></a>; it&rsquo;s a lifestyle designed to indulge you in every detail. Moreover, with eligibility for<strong data-start=\"648\" data-end=\"685\">Turkish citizenship by investment</strong>, it offers not only a dream home but also a strategic opportunity for your future.</p><p data-start=\"633\" data-end=\"1089\">&nbsp;</p><p data-start=\"772\" data-end=\"1367\">For most people, resort facilities are reserved for a one-week holiday. At Riviera Imperial Deluxe, they become part of everyday living: spa treatments, a private cinema, sports courts, indoor and outdoor pools, fine dining, and concierge-style services &mdash; all available within your own complex. Step inside the apartment itself and you&rsquo;ll notice rare touches, such as a private jacuzzi in the master bathroom, which lift this home far above the ordinary. And with the added advantage of securing<strong data-start=\"1268\" data-end=\"1291\">Turkish citizenship</strong>, this property combines lifestyle luxury with long-term investment value.</p><h2>Inside the Apartment &ndash; Luxury with Personality</h2><p>With a total area of<strong>152 m&sup2;</strong>, this four-room apartment balances spaciousness with elegance. Its plan includes a large living area, three bedrooms, and carefully designed bathrooms &mdash; one of which has been redeveloped to include a jacuzzi not found in other units of the complex.</p><p><strong>Design Language</strong></p><ul><li><p><strong>Modern-Luxury</strong>: Golden ceiling panels and bespoke LED lighting fixtures create a sleek, contemporary aesthetic.</p></li><li><p><strong>Minimalist yet Opulent</strong>: Walls are finished in light, neutral shades, while selective use of textured stone and decorative ceilings add richness.</p></li><li><p><strong>Functional Comfort</strong>: Floor heating throughout the apartment ensures warmth in all seasons, while wide glass fa&ccedil;ades flood the rooms with natural light.</p></li></ul><p>The result is an interior that feels at once calm and glamorous &mdash; a home that is just as suitable for daily family life as it is for entertaining guests.</p><h2>A Complex That Leaves Nothing Out</h2><p>Calling Riviera Imperial Deluxe a residential project feels almost modest. It is closer to a private holiday village, where every possible amenity is provided.</p><ul><li><p><strong>Wellness &amp; Spa</strong>: Turkish bath, sauna, steam room, salt room, massage facilities, and indoor pool.</p></li><li><p><strong>Sports &amp; Leisure</strong>: Football and basketball courts, tennis, mini-football, fitness center, table tennis, billiards, and cycling areas.</p></li><li><p><strong>Family-Oriented Facilities</strong>: Children&rsquo;s pools, playgrounds, kids&rsquo; rooms, and waterslides that make every day feel like a holiday for younger residents.</p></li><li><p><strong>Social Life</strong>: A cinema, restaurant, caf&eacute;, lobby, meeting rooms, and pavilions bring residents together.</p></li><li><p><strong>Hotel Services</strong>: 24/7 reception, cleaning services, guest rooms for visitors, and security systems that ensure peace of mind.</p></li><li><p><strong>Practical Comfort</strong>: Generators, panoramic elevators, parking options, and high-speed internet zones.</p></li></ul><p>With such a range of amenities, it is no exaggeration to say: living here feels like living in a self-contained luxury resort.</p><h2>Why Kargıcak Makes a Difference</h2><p>The apartment gains even more appeal thanks to its setting in<strong>Kargıcak</strong>. This neighborhood of Alanya offers a slower rhythm than the city center, with clean beaches, open landscapes, and easy access to both Mahmutlar and Alanya.</p><ul><li><p>Residents enjoy quiet surroundings without being isolated.</p></li><li><p>Public transport links (bus lines 1, 2, and 3) connect Kargıcak to the city in about twenty minutes.</p></li><li><p>Restaurants range from traditional Turkish family kitchens to seafront fish eateries and European-inspired venues near the hotels.</p></li><li><p>Outdoor activities like cycling, horse riding, and diving are close at hand, while Dim&ccedil;ayı and Dim Cave are easy day trips.</p></li></ul><p>Kargıcak appeals especially to those who want to blend everyday convenience with a lifestyle tied to nature and the sea.</p><h2>Who Will Find This Apartment Ideal?</h2><h3>Investors</h3><p>Riviera Imperial Deluxe offers some of the strongest rental potential in Alanya. Its scale, amenities, and services attract both long-term residents and holiday renters, ensuring reliable returns.</p><h3>Citizenship Seekers</h3><p>With its size and price segment, this apartment qualifies for the<strong>Turkish Citizenship by Investment</strong>program &mdash; a key advantage for international buyers seeking both a lifestyle upgrade and a second passport.</p><h3>Families</h3><p>Four spacious rooms, children&rsquo;s play zones, pools, and sports fields make this apartment perfect for family living. Parents gain peace of mind from on-site services, while children enjoy resort-style freedom.</p><h3>Comfort-Oriented Buyers</h3><p>For those who measure quality of life not only in square meters but in services and experiences, this property delivers. From the private jacuzzi to the on-site cinema and spa, the everyday becomes extraordinary.</p><h2>An Investment That Blends Prestige and Practicality</h2><p>Unlike many apartments in Alanya, this home offers both tangible financial value and intangible prestige. The rare combination of<strong>luxury hotel services and private ownership</strong>ensures that demand will remain strong, both for renting and resale. Moreover, its unique features &mdash; such as the custom jacuzzi &mdash; add individuality, making it stand out even within its own complex.</p><h2>A Partner You Can Trust</h2><p>Buying a property of this caliber requires guidance and reliability. At Luxury Estate Turkey, we make the process straightforward, transparent, and secure.</p><ul><li><p><strong>In-Depth Market Knowledge</strong>: We explain every neighborhood with clarity.</p></li><li><p><strong>Legal and Administrative Support</strong>: From title deeds to citizenship applications, every step is handled.</p></li><li><p><strong>Tailored Property Search</strong>: We match clients with homes that truly fit their goals.</p></li><li><p><strong>After-Sales Services</strong>: Rental management, resale consultancy, and property care keep your investment protected.</p></li><li><p><strong>Inspection Trips</strong>: For international buyers, we arrange visits to experience properties and surroundings firsthand.</p></li></ul><p>With us, you gain not only a property but a lasting partnership &mdash; one that prioritizes your comfort, safety, and profitability.</p><p>This<strong>4 room, 152 m&sup2; apartment in Riviera Imperial Deluxe</strong>combines the exclusivity of citizenship eligibility, the comfort of a luxury hotel, and the security of a well-managed residential complex.

    "property_description": "<div><p data-start=\"634\" data-end=\"1057\">Imagine living in a place where the sea is never more than a short stroll away. In Demirtaş, this villa sits only 150 metres from the beach, so you can enjoy the sound of waves and the fresh coastal air without being directly exposed to the bustle of the shoreline. The walk takes just a couple of minutes, making daily swims or sunset walks part of your routine, while at home you still enjoy calm, private surroundings.</p><p data-start=\"1059\" data-end=\"1469\">Unlike crowded resort zones, Demirtaş keeps a relaxed rhythm, shaped by nature and local life rather than heavy tourism. At the same time, the villa places you close to the main road connections, so Alanya center is reachable in about 40 minutes and Gazipaşa Airport in only 20 km. This combination of accessibility and serenity makes the location stand out for buyers who want both privacy and practicality.</p><h2 data-start=\"1471\" data-end=\"1519\">Exterior architecture and first impressions</h2><p data-start=\"1521\" data-end=\"1999\">The villa&rsquo;s architecture follows a modern-luxury line with clean fa&ccedil;ades, wide windows, and terraces that invite natural light. On its 350 m&sup2; plot, the house offers 180 m&sup2; of living area across two floors. A private pool framed by landscaped greenery forms the heart of the garden. Because the beach is just 150 metres away, you get the seaside lifestyle without the crowd directly outside your windows. Parking space and a camera system add everyday convenience and security.</p><h2 data-start=\"2001\" data-end=\"2055\">Interior design &mdash; a balance of modern and classic</h2><ul data-start=\"2057\" data-end=\"2763\"><li data-start=\"2057\" data-end=\"2267\"><p data-start=\"2059\" data-end=\"2267\"><strong data-start=\"2059\" data-end=\"2075\">Living room:</strong>Spacious, bright, and facing the pool.

The beaches are clean and often shallow, making them family-friendly. Local life is shaped by small markets, family-run restaurants, and agricultural landscapes. For activities, you can explore Sapadere Canyon or head to neighboring Mahmutlar and Kargıcak within 15&ndash;20 minutes for more shopping and dining. Transport is straightforward thanks to frequent buses and taxis.</p><h2 data-start=\"3614\" data-end=\"3637\">Investment outlook</h2><p data-start=\"3639\" data-end=\"4000\">Because villas for sale in Alanya this close to the sea are rare, the property carries strong investment value.

    "property_title": "Panoramic Sea View Villa in Alanya with Private Pool",
    "property_description": "<div><p data-start=\"297\" data-end=\"646\">There are homes that immediately tell their story the moment you step inside. This newly built 5 room villa in Kargıcak belongs to that category. With 250 m&sup2; of interior space, an elevated position that unlocks panoramic sea, city, and castle views, and a private pool nestled in its garden, it captures the essence of modern Mediterranean luxury.</p><p data-start=\"648\" data-end=\"1256\">The property sits just 1200 meters from the shoreline. That means you can enjoy morning swims at the beach or choose to spend afternoons in your own pool, surrounded by stone and wood textures that echo contemporary European design. At only two years old, the building offers all the reliability of modern construction while presenting the kind of architectural identity that stands out in Alanya&rsquo;s dynamic real estate market. For families, investors, and international buyers searching for a villa for sale in Alanya that combines modern design with strategic value, this home provides exactly that blend.</p><p data-start=\"1258\" data-end=\"1778\">Unlike smaller apartments in the city center, this villa offers room to breathe: five spacious bedrooms, large terraces with glass balustrades, and interiors finished with marble-effect flooring and neutral tones. Moreover, the villa&rsquo;s orientation draws the views right into the living spaces, so you never feel disconnected from the Mediterranean horizon. Consequently, it becomes not just a property but a lifestyle platform where mornings, evenings, and even work-from-home hours gain an entirely different quality.</p><h2 data-start=\"1780\" data-end=\"1836\">Exterior design &mdash; stone, wood, and glass in harmony</h2><p data-start=\"1838\" data-end=\"2156\">The fa&ccedil;ade sets the tone. Natural stone textures ground the structure, warm-toned wood claddings soften the modern lines, and wide glass panels stretch across walls to dissolve the boundary between interior and exterior. This balance creates a contemporary identity that still resonates with Mediterranean tradition.</p><p data-start=\"2158\" data-end=\"2485\">Where many older homes hide views behind small windows, this villa celebrates them. Floor-to-ceiling glazing frames the sea and Alanya Castle from multiple angles, turning every room into a viewpoint. In addition, the clean lines of the balconies, edged with transparent glass, ensure that the panorama remains uninterrupted.</p><p data-start=\"2487\" data-end=\"2685\">At night, carefully placed exterior lighting highlights textures and gives the home a resort-like glow. Guests arriving after sunset encounter not only a house but a statement of modern lifestyle.</p><h2 data-start=\"2687\" data-end=\"2746\">Interior design &mdash; generous space and modern minimalism</h2><h3 data-start=\"2748\" data-end=\"2766\">Living areas</h3><p data-start=\"2768\" data-end=\"3206\">The main salon stretches wide, its glossy marble-look ceramic flooring amplifying natural light. Large glass panels open onto terraces, allowing gatherings to flow naturally between indoor and outdoor zones. The room&rsquo;s neutral palette means future owners can choose their style: minimalistic furniture with clean lines, or more luxurious pieces in leather and velvet. Both approaches find harmony here because the finishes are flexible.</p><h3 data-start=\"3208\" data-end=\"3221\">Kitchen</h3><p data-start=\"3223\" data-end=\"3685\">The kitchen embraces open-plan living. With provision for an island, it supports both social cooking and everyday family meals. Neutral cabinetry paired with warm wood accents adds balance, while wide countertops provide ample space for preparation. For international buyers accustomed to entertaining, this layout makes hosting easy. In addition, the open design ensures constant connection with the living room and terraces, so the chef never feels isolated.</p><h3 data-start=\"3687\" data-end=\"3701\">Bedrooms</h3><p data-start=\"3703\" data-end=\"4089\">All four bedrooms are scaled generously, with oversized windows that frame mountain, sea, or castle views. Because the villa uses neutral wall and floor tones, these rooms act as blank canvases. Families can personalize them with bold colors, international buyers can bring in modern or classic furnishings, and investors preparing for rental can keep them sleek for universal appeal.</p><h3 data-start=\"4091\" data-end=\"4106\">Bathrooms</h3><p data-start=\"4108\" data-end=\"4337\">With two full bathrooms and additional guest facilities, daily routines remain smooth even for larger households. Finishes emphasize clean lines, glossy surfaces, and contemporary fittings that combine durability with elegance.</p><h3 data-start=\"4339\" data-end=\"4367\">Balconies and terraces</h3><p data-start=\"4369\" data-end=\"4746\">Each level connects to the outdoors. Balconies framed in glass expand the sense of space, while the main terrace becomes the true gathering point. Here you place outdoor sofas, dining sets, or even modern lounge chairs for sunset evenings. Because the view takes in both the city and the castle, this space holds equal appeal for quiet family moments and formal entertaining.</p><h2 data-start=\"4748\" data-end=\"4809\">Outdoor life &mdash; pool and garden as extensions of the home</h2><p data-start=\"4811\" data-end=\"5164\">The private pool integrates seamlessly into the villa&rsquo;s architecture. Surrounded by stone decking, it functions as both a leisure zone and a visual centerpiece. Palm planting and green strips soften the edges, while the possibility for personalized landscaping allows future owners to add citrus trees, Mediterranean shrubs, or minimalist Zen gardens.</p><p data-start=\"5166\" data-end=\"5479\">For families, the garden becomes a safe play area, while for investors, it is a visual selling point for short-term rentals. Moreover, the pool remains in sight from the terrace and living areas, making supervision effortless. Barbecue facilities already exist, so hosting summer evenings becomes second nature.</p><h2 data-start=\"5481\" data-end=\"5528\">Location &mdash; why Kargıcak attracts attention</h2><p data-start=\"5530\" data-end=\"5847\">Kargıcak has established itself as one of the most desirable districts of Alanya for modern villa living. Set east of the city center, it combines green hillsides with close sea access. Because the villa sits only 1200 meters from the shoreline, you can choose between a beach day and a private pool within minutes.</p><p data-start=\"5849\" data-end=\"6232\">The area remains quieter than central Alanya, which appeals to buyers who want privacy without isolation. At the same time, daily needs are nearby: supermarkets, restaurants, and transport connections all serve the neighborhood. From here, reaching Alanya city takes only a short drive, while Gazipaşa Airport lies about 25 minutes away, a major advantage for international owners.</p><p data-start=\"6234\" data-end=\"6475\">In addition, Kargıcak villas often attract investors precisely because of their location. Elevated plots grant panoramic views, yet infrastructure keeps life practical. This balance fuels strong rental potential and long-term appreciation.</p><h2 data-start=\"6477\" data-end=\"6504\">Investment perspective</h2><p data-start=\"6506\" data-end=\"6567\">From an investment angle, this villa checks multiple boxes.</p><ul data-start=\"6569\" data-end=\"7122\"><li data-start=\"6569\" data-end=\"6661\"><p data-start=\"6571\" data-end=\"6661\"><strong data-start=\"6571\" data-end=\"6606\">New construction (2 years old):</strong>Lower maintenance risk compared to older properties.</p></li><li data-start=\"6662\" data-end=\"6758\"><p data-start=\"6664\" data-end=\"6758\"><strong data-start=\"6664\" data-end=\"6700\">Generous size (250 m&sup2;, 5 rooms):</strong>Meets demand from larger families and high-end tenants.</p></li><li data-start=\"6759\" data-end=\"6845\"><p data-start=\"6761\" data-end=\"6845\"><strong data-start=\"6761\" data-end=\"6796\">Private pool and modern design:</strong>Essential features for luxury holiday rentals.</p></li><li data-start=\"6846\" data-end=\"6945\"><p data-start=\"6848\" data-end=\"6945\"><strong data-start=\"6848\" data-end=\"6899\">Panoramic views (sea, castle, city, mountains):</strong>High visual impact that enhances marketing.</p></li><li data-start=\"6946\" data-end=\"7031\"><p data-start=\"6948\" data-end=\"7031\"><strong data-start=\"6948\" data-end=\"6978\">Proximity to sea (1200 m):</strong>Close enough for convenience, far enough for calm.</p></li><li data-start=\"7032\" data-end=\"7122\"><p data-start=\"7034\" data-end=\"7122\"><strong data-start=\"7034\" data-end=\"7068\">Cash payment &ndash; discount offer:</strong>Additional financial advantage for decisive buyers.</p></li></ul><p data-start=\"7124\" data-end=\"7466\">Consequently, whether you plan to use it personally or rent it seasonally, the villa maintains strong yield potential.

For long-term residents, the spacious plan and private garden make it a year-round home.</p><h2 data-start=\"7468\" data-end=\"7496\">Lifestyle possibilities</h2><ul data-start=\"7971\" data-end=\"8474\"><li data-start=\"7498\" data-end=\"7630\"><p data-start=\"7500\" data-end=\"7630\"><strong data-start=\"7500\" data-end=\"7534\">Families relocating to Alanya:</strong>Each child has a room, parents enjoy private spaces, and shared areas encourage togetherness.</p></li><li data-start=\"7631\" data-end=\"7735\"><p data-start=\"7633\" data-end=\"7735\"><strong data-start=\"7633\" data-end=\"7672\">Retirees seeking comfort and views:</strong>Low-maintenance modern build with terraces to enjoy sunsets.</p></li><li data-start=\"7736\" data-end=\"7825\"><p data-start=\"7738\" data-end=\"7825\"><strong data-start=\"7738\" data-end=\"7762\">Holiday-home buyers:</strong>Balance between proximity to beaches and privacy of a villa.</p></li><li data-start=\"7826\" data-end=\"7936\"><p data-start=\"7828\" data-end=\"7936\"><strong data-start=\"7828\" data-end=\"7860\">Investors in luxury rentals:</strong>Strong marketing appeal thanks to pool, views, and contemporary finishes.</p></li></ul><h2 data-start=\"8476\" data-end=\"8515\">Why work with Luxury Estate Turkey</h2><p data-start=\"8517\" data-end=\"8669\">Buying a villa in Alanya is more than a transaction.

    "property_description": "<div><h2 data-start=\"545\" data-end=\"659\">Have you ever wondered what it feels like to own a<a href=\"https://luxuryestateturkey.com/en/real-estate/turkey/alanya\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">property in Alanya</a>where hotels once guarded every inch of the shoreline?</h2><p data-start=\"661\" data-end=\"1038\">For decades, Oba&rsquo;s Mediterranean coast was claimed almost entirely by hotels. Tourists enjoyed the beachfront; residents settled a few streets behind. Then came a rare shift &mdash; a three-star hotel was transformed into<strong data-start=\"877\" data-end=\"901\">Serenity Royal Beach</strong>, a residential complex that changed the rules. Suddenly, the dream of living directly on the seafront in Oba was no longer impossible.</p><p data-start=\"1040\" data-end=\"1411\">This is not just another apartment in Alanya.<strong>It is a home built on one of the most privileged pieces of land in the region: seafront, with private beach access, concierge-style services, and amenities designed to rival high-end resorts</strong>. In a market where such opportunities simply do not exist, Serenity Royal Beach offers buyers both exclusivity and everyday comfort.</p><h2>A Living Space That Redefines Elegance</h2><p>Inside this 89 m&sup2; apartment, every detail speaks of sophistication. The layout includes two bedrooms and a spacious living room, creating a balanced home for both private retreat and social gatherings.</p><p><strong>Flooring with Drama and Balance</strong><br />The living room and corridors feature large marble-effect tiles, their polished surfaces catching the light and amplifying space. This glossy finish adds a theatrical sense of openness, setting the tone for luxury. In the bedrooms, designers chose warm wood-effect parquet, softening the mood and creating a tranquil retreat. Together, these choices reflect an intentional contrast: grandeur in shared spaces, calm in personal ones.</p><p><strong>Ceiling Artistry and Lighting Ambiance</strong><br />Ceilings are framed with linear LED strips, clean and modern, while chandeliers in crystal and gold tones act as focal points. These fixtures do more than illuminate; they cast decorative patterns of light across the room, turning illumination into art. Especially in the salon, the chandeliers serve as both lighting and sculptural presence.</p><p><strong>A Kitchen with Its Own Personality</strong><br />Forget standard layouts &mdash; here, cabinetry blends wood tones with white surfaces and geometric details. The marble backsplash mirrors the floor&rsquo;s veining, tying the whole composition together. Functionality is high, but the look is boutique-hotel chic, elevating even the daily act of cooking.</p><p><strong>Furniture and Arrangement</strong><br />The current d&eacute;cor presents a Chesterfield-style cream sofa paired with black-and-gold tables, merging timeless elegance with contemporary edge. In the dining area, a round table and velvet chairs create a welcoming yet refined setting. Bedrooms continue the sophisticated rhythm, with dark-toned headboards, wall panels, and striking lighting that add depth and presence.</p><p><strong>Details That Leave an Impression</strong><br />Wood veneers, gold accents, geometric surface designs, and rich drapery make the d&eacute;cor bold and character-driven. At the same time, they offer the comfort of a luxury hotel suite &mdash; not just visually stunning, but deeply livable.</p><h2>Seafront Living with Everyday Resort Comfort</h2><p>Serenity Royal Beach doesn&rsquo;t stop at interiors. What sets this project apart is the lifestyle it enables. Built on land that almost no resident can access, it offers something unique:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Direct Access to the Sea</strong>&ndash; A private underpass leads straight to the beach club, ensuring both convenience and privacy.</p></li><li><p><strong>Concierge and Assistance Services</strong>&ndash; From deliveries to 24-hour reception, daily life is supported with hotel-level care.</p></li><li><p><strong>Wellness Facilities</strong>&ndash; Indoor and outdoor pools, Turkish bath, steam rooms, massage spaces, and a relaxing room create a holistic wellness environment.</p></li><li><p><strong>Recreation and Social Life</strong>&ndash; A cinema, meeting rooms, and communal lounges extend living beyond the apartment.</p></li><li><p><strong>Family-Friendly Features</strong>&ndash; Children&rsquo;s pool, playgrounds, and dedicated rooms ensure younger residents are just as comfortable.</p></li><li><p><strong>Practical Infrastructure</strong>&ndash; Generator backup, secure parking, lobby, and door security ensure peace of mind.</p></li></ul><p>Moreover, the complex is<strong>frontline to the beach</strong>&mdash; not metaphorically, but literally. Step outside and you are in front of the Mediterranean. This alone makes Serenity Royal Beach stand apart in Oba, where nearly every other project sits inland.</p><h2>Oba &ndash; Where Daily Life Flows with Ease</h2><p>The apartment&rsquo;s location in Oba reinforces its appeal. Known for its wide sandy beaches, palm-lined promenades, and blend of local life with modern conveniences, Oba is one of Alanya&rsquo;s most comfortable areas for long-term living.</p><p>Residents enjoy:</p><ul><li><p>Weekly markets on Mondays and Thursdays, with fresh produce, clothing, and household goods.</p></li><li><p>A wide range of cafes and restaurants offering cuisines from around the world.</p></li><li><p>Proximity to Alanya Training and Research Hospital, adding peace of mind for families and retirees.</p></li><li><p>Smooth public transport connections, as nearly every bus line passes through Oba, linking quickly to the city center, Tosmur, Kestel, and Mahmutlar.</p></li><li><p>Leisure opportunities from cycling along the seafront path to playing tennis or football in local facilities.</p></li></ul><p>Living here means never needing to compromise between relaxation and practicality. Everything essential is within reach, and everything enjoyable is within walking distance.</p><h2>Who Will Feel Drawn to Serenity Royal Beach?</h2><h3>Couples and Families Seeking Luxury</h3><p>The seafront setting, private beach club, and on-site services create an atmosphere where everyday life feels like a holiday. For couples or families who value high living standards, this is a home that ensures both prestige and comfort.</p><h3>International Investors</h3><p>In Alanya&rsquo;s market, seafront properties are scarce and therefore carry enduring value. This apartment, with its luxury positioning and full range of amenities, is primed for both long-term tenants and premium short-term holiday rentals. High rental yields are realistic, given the uniqueness of the location.</p><h3>Retirees and Long-Term Residents</h3><p>For those looking to spend their retirement years by the sea, Serenity Royal Beach provides security, services, and a peaceful yet connected lifestyle. Everything from healthcare to social activities is close at hand.</p><h3>Prestige-Oriented Buyers</h3><p>Some buyers are drawn not only by location or returns but by the desire to own something that signals status. The luxury d&eacute;cor, seafront setting, and rare availability of such a property make it a clear statement of prestige.</p><h2>A Rare Investment in Oba&rsquo;s Real Estate Landscape</h2><p>Serenity Royal Beach is not simply a home &mdash; it is an investment in rarity. With almost all of Oba&rsquo;s seafront land occupied by hotels, projects like this will not appear again easily. That scarcity translates into long-term value.</p><p>Investors gain not only from strong rental demand but also from capital appreciation over time. The project&rsquo;s combination of luxury design, concierge services, and unbeatable location ensures that its worth will grow, making it both a lifestyle choice and a financial asset.</p><h2>Partnering with the Right Team!</h2><p>Navigating the purchase of such a property in Alanya requires expertise. At<a href=\"https://luxuryestateturkey.com/en\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Luxury Estate Turkey</a>, our mission is to make the process secure, transparent, and tailored to each client&rsquo;s needs.</p><ul><li><p><strong>Market Knowledge</strong>&ndash; We understand the dynamics of Alanya&rsquo;s neighborhoods, explaining them clearly for international buyers.</p></li><li><p><strong>Legal Support</strong>&ndash; From contracts to residence permit applications, every detail is managed with care.</p></li><li><p><strong>Personalized Search</strong>&ndash; We match properties to lifestyle goals, whether family living, investment, or holiday retreat.</p></li><li><p><strong>After-Sales Services</strong>&ndash; Property management, rental assistance, and resale support extend our relationship beyond purchase.</p></li><li><p><strong>Inspection Trips</strong>&ndash; For buyers abroad, we arrange guided visits, ensuring decisions are made with full confidence.</p></li></ul><p>By choosing us, you gain not just access to exclusive listings but also a partner committed to your long-term satisfaction and security.</p><p>This 3 room, 89 m&sup2; apartment at Serenity Royal Beach offers something few properties in Oba can: a direct connection to the Mediterranean, interiors styled with luxury and personality, and a complex that combines resort amenities with private residential living.</p><p><strong>Are you ready to step into a home where the sea is not just a view, but your everyday reality?

    "property_title": "Exceptional Seafront Apartment in Kucuker Seaside Residence Alanya",
    "property_description": "<div><p class=\"whitespace-normal break-words\">Please picture this: you're having your morning coffee, and instead of staring at another apartment building, you're watching the sun dance across the Mediterranean while Alanya Castle stands guard in the distance. Sounds like something from a travel magazine, right? Well, this 165m&sup2; seafront<a href=\"https://luxuryestateturkey.com/en/real-estate/turkey/alanya\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">apartment for sale in Alanya</a>Tosmur at Kucuker Sea Side Residence could make that<strong>your everyday reality.</strong></p><p class=\"whitespace-normal break-words\">You know how most beachfront properties claim to be \"close to the sea\" but you still need a five-minute walk to actually touch the water? Not here. This place sits directly on the coastline with its own private beach. When I say private, I mean you can literally roll out of bed and be swimming in the Mediterranean before you're fully awake. That's the kind of convenience that makes you wonder why you ever settled for anything less.</p><h2>What Makes This Seafront Apartment for Sale in Alanya Tosmur Different?</h2><p>Let's talk about location for a minute because honestly, it's everything in real estate. Tosmur isn't just another coastal neighborhood trying to ride on Alanya's reputation. This area has its own personality, and once you spend a day here, you'll understand why<strong>locals guard it like a secret.</strong></p><p>The Kucuker Sea Side Residence sits right where the Mediterranean meets sophisticated living. Not in some touristy strip where you're fighting crowds for a decent sunset photo, but in a spot where you get front-row seats to nature's daily show. We're talking about 300 days a year of spectacular sunsets that'll make your Instagram followers seriously question their life choices.</p><p>But here's what really sets this place apart - the Kucuker Sea Side Residence's design actually makes sense. The architects didn't just slap together another concrete box and call it luxury. They thought about how the light moves throughout the day, where the best views are, and how to make every room feel connected to that incredible sea view. Consequently, you're not stuck with one tiny window facing the water while the rest of your home feels like it could be anywhere.</p><h2>Walking Through Your Potential New Home</h2><h3>The Living Spaces That Actually Live Well</h3><p>Step inside, and you'll notice something immediately - this doesn't feel like a typical apartment. The designers went with a modern Scandinavian approach, which basically means everything looks effortlessly elegant without trying too hard. Think clean lines, natural materials, and colors that make you feel calm the moment you walk in.</p><p>The living and dining area flows together in that open-plan way that's become popular, but they did it right here. You're not left with one giant empty space that echoes when you talk. Instead, you get distinct areas that still feel connected. The big windows frame the sea view like it's a massive piece of artwork that changes throughout the day. Early morning, you get those soft golden tones. By evening, you're watching the sun paint the sky in colors that somehow look different every single day.</p><p>Moreover, the lighting system deserves a mention because someone clearly understood that harsh overhead lights kill any romantic dinner or relaxed evening vibe. The hidden LED strips in the ceiling provide gentle illumination that actually enhances the atmosphere instead of destroying it.</p><h3>A Kitchen That Invites You to Actually Cook</h3><p>Here's something refreshing - a kitchen designed by people who apparently cook. The L-shaped layout gives you enough counter space to prep a proper meal without feeling cramped. The white cabinets against dark countertops create that classic contrast that never goes out of style, plus everything stays looking clean and modern.</p><p>All the appliances are integrated, including the microwave and oven, which means no mismatched items cluttering up your space. If you're someone who loves to entertain, you'll appreciate how the kitchen connects to the living area without overwhelming it. You can prep dinner while chatting with guests, or whip up a quick breakfast while enjoying your sea view.</p><p>Therefore, whether you're a serious cook or someone who mostly reheats takeout, this kitchen works for your lifestyle. The best part? Everything comes included, so you can start using it immediately instead of spending months hunting for the right appliances.</p><h2>The Amenities That Make Hotel Living Seem Basic</h2><h3>Water, Water Everywhere</h3><p>Let's be honest - most apartment complexes promise great amenities and deliver a small, overcrowded pool that's more chlorine than water. Not here. You get both indoor and outdoor pools, which means you can<strong>swim year-round regardless of the weather outside.</strong></p><p>The outdoor pool area feels like something from a resort. You're surrounded by professionally landscaped gardens with the Mediterranean as your backdrop. Meanwhile, the indoor pool gives you that option for cooler days or when you want a more private swimming experience. Both pools are maintained by professional staff, so you're always diving into clean, properly treated water.</p><p>For families, there's a dedicated children's pool area where kids can splash safely while parents relax nearby. It's those thoughtful touches that show someone actually planned this complex for real people, not just photo opportunities.</p><h3>Wellness Without the Membership Fees</h3><p>The fitness center includes modern equipment that actually gets maintained and replaced when needed. No more hoping that treadmill doesn't break down mid-workout or finding out the air conditioning stopped working three weeks ago.</p><p>But here's where things get interesting - this place includes a traditional Turkish bath and sauna. If you've never experienced a proper Turkish bath, you're in for something special. It's not just about getting clean; it's a whole relaxation ritual that leaves you feeling renewed. Additionally, there's a dedicated massage room where you can book professional treatments without leaving the complex.</p><p>Furthermore, the outdoor areas include barbecue facilities and comfortable seating areas throughout the landscaped gardens. Sunday afternoon barbecues with friends become effortless when everything you need is right there.</p><h2>Tosmur: The Neighborhood That Locals Don't Want Tourists to Discover</h2><h3>Dim River: Nature's Air Conditioning</h3><p>You know how every coastal town claims to have something special? Tosmur actually delivers with the Dim River. This isn't some muddy stream pretending to be a natural attraction. We're talking about crystal-clear mountain water that stays refreshingly cool even during the hottest summer days.</p><p>The river area has become a local gathering spot where families set up picnics under the trees while kids splash in the natural pools. There are family-run restaurants along the riverbank serving authentic Turkish dishes that haven't been modified for tourist palates. When you want something more active, there's even a go-kart track for some friendly competition.</p><p>Therefore, living in Tosmur means you get both the Mediterranean sea and mountain river experiences without choosing between them. Hot summer day? Cool off in the river. Want to swim in salt water? The private beach is steps from your door.</p><h3>Shopping That Feels Like Community</h3><p>Forget fighting crowds at massive shopping malls. Tosmur operates on a more human scale. The neighborhood has multiple supermarkets competing for your business, which means better prices and fresher products. Local butchers and produce vendors know their customers and take pride in what they offer.</p><p>Thursday brings the weekly market, which transforms into something like Istanbul's Grand Bazaar but without the aggressive tourist targeting. You'll find fresh produce, household goods, clothing, and cosmetics all in one place. Moreover, it's where you start recognizing faces and becoming part of the community rather than just another foreign resident.</p><p>Meanwhile, everything stays within walking distance. Need groceries? Five-minute walk. Want fresh bread? Three minutes. Pharmacy? Right around the corner. It's the kind of convenience that makes car ownership optional rather than essential for daily life.</p><h2>Getting Around: Easier Than You'd Expect</h2><h3>Airport Access That Actually Makes Sense</h3><p>One of the smartest things about choosing this seafront apartment for sale in Alanya Tosmur is the transportation situation. Gazipasa Airport sits just 45 kilometers away, which means your international guests don't need to endure a grueling journey to reach you. Antalya Airport, while further at 125 kilometers, remains completely manageable for those who prefer more flight options.</p><p>But here's the real convenience - bus connections run frequently throughout the day to Alanya center and other popular areas. The bus stops are literally on every corner, so you're never walking more than a couple of minutes to catch public transport. Additionally, the buses are clean, air-conditioned, and operated by professional drivers who actually follow schedules.</p><p>Furthermore, when you do want to explore beyond Tosmur, places like Kestel, Oba, and Cikcilli are all nearby, each with their own character and attractions. You get variety without the hassle of long-distance travel.</p><h2>The Investment Side Nobody Talks About Honestly</h2><h3>Rental Income That Actually Materializes</h3><p>Let's cut through the typical investment property nonsense you usually hear. Yes, this seafront apartment for sale in Alanya Tosmur can generate rental income, but let's talk realistic numbers and expectations.</p><p>Properties with private beach access and genuine sea views command premium rates because they offer something most rentals can't match - exclusivity. Your guests aren't just renting an apartment; they're renting a lifestyle experience. The resort-style amenities mean they don't need to hunt for pools, gyms, or entertainment options elsewhere.</p><p>However, success in the rental market requires proper management, competitive pricing, and maintaining high standards. The property comes fully furnished and move-in ready, which eliminates your initial setup costs and accelerates your ability to start generating income.</p><h3>Long-term Value: The Uncomfortable Truth</h3><p>Waterfront properties with private beach access are becoming increasingly rare along developed coastlines worldwide. While I can't promise specific appreciation rates, simple supply and demand suggests that scarcity creates value over time.</p><p>Turkey's continued infrastructure investments in the region, including airport improvements and highway connections, enhance accessibility and attract more international interest. Meanwhile, Alanya's evolution from seasonal resort destination to year-round living location supports sustained property demand.</p><p>But honestly? Buy this place because you want to live this lifestyle, not because you're chasing investment returns. If the numbers work out long-term, consider it a bonus rather than the primary motivation.</p><h2>Security and Management That Actually Functions</h2><h3>Protection That Goes Beyond Cameras</h3><p>The 24/7 security system includes trained personnel who actually pay attention, not just someone sitting behind a desk playing on their phone. The camera coverage monitors common areas and entry points, while door security systems ensure only authorized individuals access the building.</p><p>Professional caretakers handle maintenance requests, coordinate deliveries, and provide assistance with various resident needs. They're the people who make sure the elevator actually works, the pool stays clean, and small problems get fixed before becoming big headaches.</p><p>Additionally, backup generator systems maintain power during outages, which unfortunately happen occasionally in any developing area. You're not left in the dark or stuck between floors when the local grid has issues.</p><h2>Move-in Ready: No Hidden Surprises</h2><h3>Everything Included, Seriously</h3><p>This seafront apartment for sale in Alanya Tosmur comes completely furnished with pieces selected to complement the modern design. We're not talking about cheap furniture that looks good in photos but falls apart after six months. These are quality pieces chosen by people who understand both style and durability.</p><p>The white goods package includes all major appliances - refrigerator, washing machine, dishwasher, and cooking equipment. Kitchen items, cookware, and basic household supplies mean you can prepare meals immediately rather than spending weeks shopping for essentials.</p><p>Bedroom linens, towels, and bathroom accessories complete the package. Essentially, you can arrive with your personal belongings and start living comfortably from day one. No assembly required, no compatibility issues, no unexpected additional expenses.</p><h2>Why Work with Luxury Estate Turkey: The Honest Answer</h2><p>Look, choosing a real estate agent for international property purchases isn't just about who has the nicest website or makes the biggest promises. You need someone who understands the actual process, not just the marketing side of things.</p><p>Our experience in<a href=\"https://luxuryestateturkey.com/en/real-estate/turkey\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Turkish market</a>means we've seen the mistakes other buyers make and can help you avoid them. We understand visa requirements, financing options, property management realities, and the legal processes that protect your investment.

Instead, we provide honest assessments of both opportunities and challenges, helping you make informed decisions based on accurate information rather than sales pressure.</p><p>Our multilingual team communicates clearly with international clients while maintaining strong connections with Turkish professionals and government offices.

    "property_title": "Panoramic Villa in Alanya with Sea, Castle, and City Views",
    "property_description": "<div><p data-start=\"330\" data-end=\"820\">Imagine stepping into your living room and being greeted by uninterrupted views that stretch from the Mediterranean Sea to Alanya Castle, across the green slopes of the Taurus Mountains, and over the lively city below. This villa in Kargıcak captures that panorama from almost every angle, thanks to its clever orientation toward the south, west, and north. Light enters through wide windows, terraces extend the rooms outdoors, and every moment of the day feels connected to the scenery.</p><p data-start=\"822\" data-end=\"1294\">Unlike many standard villas for sale in Alanya, this property offers much more than square meters and furniture. It belongs to Toros 3 Villas, a well-established residential site known for its landscaped gardens, large pools, aqua park, and reliable security. Yet the villa maintains its independence with a private garden, its own garage, a sauna, and a dressing room. As a result, you enjoy both the advantages of community facilities and the privacy of your own home.</p><p data-start=\"1296\" data-end=\"1640\">With five full bedrooms, five bathrooms, an American-style kitchen, and 220 m&sup2; of interior space, the villa meets the needs of large families, long-stay residents, and investors looking for rental-ready opportunities. Moreover, its full furnishings and neutral d&eacute;cor make it immediately livable, while still leaving room for personal touches.</p><h2 data-start=\"1642\" data-end=\"1707\">Layout and interior design &mdash; a balance of classic and modern</h2><p data-start=\"1709\" data-end=\"1977\">The villa spreads across three floors, creating clear separation between social and private zones. The ground floor is designed for gatherings, the middle and upper levels provide quiet bedrooms, and the rooftop terraces crown the experience with breathtaking views.</p><h3 data-start=\"1979\" data-end=\"2029\">Living room &mdash; panoramic stage for daily life</h3><p data-start=\"2031\" data-end=\"2465\">The salon stands out with large windows that bring the sea and city skyline inside. Cream and beige tones dominate the furniture, supporting the scenery without competing with it. Classic details such as the ceiling&rsquo;s decorative moldings add a sense of tradition, while glass coffee tables and lighter accessories balance it with a modern note. This interplay of styles ensures the interior feels warm and elegant rather than heavy.</p><h3 data-start=\"2467\" data-end=\"2491\">Kitchen and dining</h3><p data-start=\"2493\" data-end=\"2844\">The American kitchen links easily to the dining zone, so conversations flow naturally while meals are prepared. White cabinets and functional appliances keep the atmosphere bright, while neutral flooring continues the light theme. Families who value separate cooking spaces will find the arrangement practical, especially when hosting larger groups.</p><h3 data-start=\"2846\" data-end=\"2860\">Bedrooms</h3><p data-start=\"2862\" data-end=\"3301\">The main bedroom enjoys direct access to a terrace, turning morning routines into a peaceful ritual with fresh air and wide views. Furnishings remain modern and streamlined, with plenty of wardrobe space. Other bedrooms are simpler in d&eacute;cor, ready for customization by children, guests, or a home office. Each room benefits from natural light, and with five bathrooms available, comfort remains uninterrupted even when the villa is full.</p><h3 data-start=\"3303\" data-end=\"3342\">Sauna, storage, and dressing room</h3><p data-start=\"3344\" data-end=\"3588\">Luxury touches set this property apart. A private sauna encourages wellness at home, while the dedicated dressing room adds both functionality and prestige. The extra storage space ensures the villa feels uncluttered even during longer stays.</p><h3 data-start=\"3590\" data-end=\"3618\">Balconies and terraces</h3><p data-start=\"3620\" data-end=\"3942\">The villa&rsquo;s terraces form a continuous link between indoor and outdoor living. Rattan seating, a built-in barbecue area, and wide surfaces for evening dinners create spaces where daily life merges with leisure. The largest terrace becomes an outdoor living room, perfect for long summer evenings with family and friends.</p><h2 data-start=\"3944\" data-end=\"3998\">Outdoor life &mdash; private garden and site facilities</h2><p data-start=\"4000\" data-end=\"4360\">In addition to the private garden and garage, the villa benefits from the broader facilities of Toros 3 Villas. Residents share landscaped gardens, children&rsquo;s play areas, and several swimming pools, including an aqua park pool for families. Fitness rooms, meeting spaces, and gazebos add variety, while 24/7 security and camera systems provide peace of mind.</p><p data-start=\"4362\" data-end=\"4594\">Your own garden remains distinct, with enough space for outdoor dining, potted plants, or simple landscaping according to taste. The garage offers secure parking, and the barbecue area becomes a natural focal point for gatherings.</p><h2 data-start=\"4596\" data-end=\"4639\">Technical details that support comfort</h2><ul data-start=\"4641\" data-end=\"5026\"><li data-start=\"4641\" data-end=\"4660\"><p data-start=\"4643\" data-end=\"4660\">220 m&sup2; interior</p></li><li data-start=\"4661\" data-end=\"4688\"><p data-start=\"4663\" data-end=\"4688\">5 rooms and 5 bathrooms</p></li><li data-start=\"4689\" data-end=\"4718\"><p data-start=\"4691\" data-end=\"4718\">Full furnishings included</p></li><li data-start=\"4719\" data-end=\"4739\"><p data-start=\"4721\" data-end=\"4739\">American kitchen</p></li><li data-start=\"4740\" data-end=\"4778\"><p data-start=\"4742\" data-end=\"4778\">Sauna, dressing room, storage area</p></li><li data-start=\"4779\" data-end=\"4817\"><p data-start=\"4781\" data-end=\"4817\">South, west, and north orientation</p></li><li data-start=\"4818\" data-end=\"4847\"><p data-start=\"4820\" data-end=\"4847\">Private garden and garage</p></li><li data-start=\"4848\" data-end=\"4892\"><p data-start=\"4850\" data-end=\"4892\">Three floors with balconies and terraces</p></li><li data-start=\"4893\" data-end=\"4967\"><p data-start=\"4895\" data-end=\"4967\">Part of Toros 3 Villa complex with pools, aqua park, gym, and security</p></li><li data-start=\"4968\" data-end=\"4994\"><p data-start=\"4970\" data-end=\"4994\">Only 1 km from the sea</p></li><li data-start=\"4995\" data-end=\"5026\"><p data-start=\"4997\" data-end=\"5026\">High rental yield potential</p></li></ul><h2 data-start=\"5028\" data-end=\"5091\">Location &mdash; Kargıcak&rsquo;s unique mix of nature and convenience</h2><p data-start=\"5093\" data-end=\"5432\">Kargıcak lies just east of Alanya, close enough to reach the city center within 15 minutes yet far enough to enjoy peace and cleaner air. The area is known for its rolling hills, pine forests, and expansive Mediterranean views. From this villa, you look not only to the sea but also across to Alanya Castle and the surrounding mountains.</p><p data-start=\"5434\" data-end=\"5791\">Shops, markets, and daily services remain close, while beaches are only a kilometer away.

    "property_title": "Citizenship Eligible Garden Villa with Private Pool in Alanya",
    "property_description": "<div><p data-start=\"383\" data-end=\"771\">There are homes you step into and instantly feel that they were designed for living, not just for show. This villa in Konaklı belongs to that category. With its generous 200 m&sup2; plan, five full rooms, a garden filled with Mediterranean trees, and a private pool that becomes the heart of summer days, it offers more than walls and square meters. It offers rhythm, routine, and lifestyle.</p><p data-start=\"773\" data-end=\"1277\">Konaklı itself sets the stage. Just west of Alanya center, the district is known for its long sandy beaches, vibrant weekly bazaar, and relaxed pace. Living here means you wake up to the sound of cicadas, walk to the sea in a few minutes, and still have easy access to shopping centers, schools, and transport. In short, you enjoy balance: privacy and calm at home, activity and convenience nearby. That is why buyers searching for a villa for sale in Alanya often end up in Konaklı &mdash; it delivers both.</p><p data-start=\"1279\" data-end=\"1707\">This villa carries a Mediterranean identity through its garden and terraces, while also ticking the right boxes for international investors: residence permit eligibility, Turkish citizenship suitability, and features that match rental demand. Moreover, with a separate kitchen, multiple bathrooms, private parking, and a wide terrace, it meets the long-term comfort standards of families who plan to live in Alanya year-round.</p><h2 data-start=\"1709\" data-end=\"1756\">Outdoor living &mdash; garden, terrace, and pool</h2><p data-start=\"1758\" data-end=\"2110\">The garden is more than decorative; it is part of daily life. Olive and fruit trees root the property in the Mediterranean landscape, while palms and green patches provide shade and softness. A hammock area under the trees encourages slow afternoons. Children find space to play safely, and adults enjoy quiet corners for reading or working outdoors.</p><p data-start=\"2112\" data-end=\"2403\">The private pool sits at the center of this lifestyle. Morning swims, evening cool-offs, and weekend gatherings all revolve around it. Because the pool is framed by stone paving, maintenance remains practical. Next to it, a barbecue corner invites summer meals that stretch into the night.</p><p data-start=\"2405\" data-end=\"2730\">The veranda and terrace extend the interior into the open air. With rustic wooden seating, the space already has charm; however, adding rattan furniture and soft lighting would strengthen the Mediterranean-modern style. In this way, the villa shifts seamlessly from day to night, from family breakfasts to friendly dinners.</p><h2 data-start=\"2732\" data-end=\"2779\">Interior layout &mdash; designed for flexibility</h2><h3 data-start=\"2781\" data-end=\"2798\">Living room</h3><p data-start=\"2800\" data-end=\"3155\">The main living room is spacious, with light-colored ceramic flooring and cream walls. Current furniture mixes modern and classic: an L-shaped sofa sits next to patterned armchairs, creating warmth. To modernize, one could opt for monochrome upholstery and minimalist d&eacute;cor. Regardless, the space works well for both family gatherings and guest entertainment.</p><h3 data-start=\"3157\" data-end=\"3170\">Kitchen</h3><p data-start=\"3172\" data-end=\"3486\">A bold highlight of the villa, the kitchen contrasts glossy red cabinetry with white units. It feels retro-modern, energetic, and eye-catching. For broader appeal, future owners may choose matte white or wood-tone replacements, which would calm the space and make it easier to pair with various furniture styles.</p><h3 data-start=\"3488\" data-end=\"3502\">Bedrooms</h3><p data-start=\"3504\" data-end=\"3793\">Five rooms give plenty of options. The main bedroom uses darker wood furniture and neutral tones, leaning classic. Children&rsquo;s rooms are colorful and functional. For buyers, this flexibility means you can adapt spaces: one room for a home office, another for a gym, or even a guest suite.</p><h3 data-start=\"3795\" data-end=\"3810\">Bathrooms</h3><p data-start=\"3812\" data-end=\"4066\">Two bathrooms serve the villa, with the upper-level bathroom featuring a jacuzzi. The contrast of black and white surfaces creates a sleek, modern feel. This touch of luxury elevates daily routines and strengthens the villa&rsquo;s appeal for rental markets.</p><h3 data-start=\"4068\" data-end=\"4097\">Extra multipurpose area</h3><p data-start=\"4099\" data-end=\"4302\">The upper floor includes a large secondary lounge. Families can convert it into a home cinema, a games room, or a workout zone. This versatility ensures the property adapts to different stages of life.</p><h2 data-start=\"4304\" data-end=\"4328\">Decoration analysis</h2><p data-start=\"4330\" data-end=\"4743\">The villa currently balances classic and modern. Traditional patterned furniture mixes with bold, modern kitchen colors. This hybrid character gives the house authenticity, but small updates could align it with luxury market expectations. Neutralizing the kitchen cabinetry, simplifying wall d&eacute;cor, and layering modern textiles would position it as a contemporary Mediterranean villa without losing local charm.</p><h2 data-start=\"4745\" data-end=\"4781\">Lifestyle advantages of Konaklı</h2><p data-start=\"4783\" data-end=\"5123\">Living in Konaklı means proximity to everything yet enough space to breathe. The sea is only 400 meters away &mdash; a five-minute walk for daily swims. Weekly markets supply fresh local produce, while supermarkets and shops meet daily needs. Caf&eacute;s and restaurants along the coastline range from casual Turkish grills to international kitchens.</p><p data-start=\"5125\" data-end=\"5477\">Transport is easy. Minibuses connect Konaklı to Alanya center in about 15 minutes, and Antalya Airport is reachable within an hour and a half. Families appreciate the schools and healthcare options nearby. Moreover, Konaklı remains less crowded than central Alanya, which makes it a favorite for those who want residential calm with city convenience.</p><h2 data-start=\"5479\" data-end=\"5535\">Investment perspective &mdash; why this villa holds value</h2><ul data-start=\"5537\" data-end=\"6206\"><li data-start=\"5537\" data-end=\"5714\"><p data-start=\"5539\" data-end=\"5714\"><strong data-start=\"5539\" data-end=\"5567\">Citizenship eligibility:</strong>The property&rsquo;s value and documentation align with Turkish citizenship through investment, making it a strategic choice for international buyers.</p></li><li data-start=\"5715\" data-end=\"5825\"><p data-start=\"5717\" data-end=\"5825\"><strong data-start=\"5717\" data-end=\"5747\">Residence permit eligible:</strong>Buyers who want to live in Turkey long-term gain an easy path to residency.</p></li><li data-start=\"5826\" data-end=\"6009\"><p data-start=\"5828\" data-end=\"6009\"><strong data-start=\"5828\" data-end=\"5849\">Rental potential:</strong>Villas with pools and gardens close to the beach are in constant demand for seasonal rentals.

    "property_title": "Seafront Residence Permit Eligible Apartment in Alanya",
    "property_description": "<div><h2>Seafront Apartment for Sale in Alanya &ndash; Residence Permit Eligible with Castle &amp; Sea Views</h2><p>Let's be honest &ndash; how many times have you scrolled through social media, seen someone's beachfront breakfast photo, and thought \"I need that life\"? Well, here's your chance to stop double-tapping and start living. This stunning<strong>4 room seafront apartment in Alanya, Tosmur</strong>isn't just a property in Turkey; it's your ticket to becoming that person whose Instagram makes everyone else slightly jealous.</p><p>Picture this: you wake up naturally (no more brutal alarm clocks, thank you very much) to Mediterranean sunlight streaming through your windows. Your morning routine? A leisurely stroll to your floor-to-ceiling windows where the turquoise sea greets you like an old friend. And yes, that's Alanya Castle in the distance &ndash; because apparently your new life comes with its own medieval backdrop. Talk about living the dream!</p><p>This isn't your typical apartment viewing where you need to imagine away the previous owner's questionable wallpaper choices. At 160 m&sup2; of pure coastal elegance, this place comes fully furnished with taste that would make interior design magazines weep with joy.&nbsp;</p><p class=\"whitespace-normal break-words\">Now, let's talk about that south and southwest orientation &ndash; and no, this isn't boring real estate jargon. This means your home is basically a solar panel for happiness. Golden hour lighting? You've got it from sunrise to sunset. Those moody, perfectly lit selfies? They're happening whether you try or not. Your friends back home dealing with grey skies will be asking for your secret, and you can casually mention, \"Oh, it's just the Mediterranean lifestyle.\"</p><p class=\"whitespace-normal break-words\">Here's where things get really exciting: this area is open for residence permits. Translation? You can actually make this paradise your permanent address. Whether you're a savvy investor who knows a good thing when you see it, or someone ready to trade the daily grind for daily beach walks, this property opens doors &ndash; quite literally &ndash; to your new Turkish adventure.</p><p class=\"whitespace-normal break-words\">And can we talk about the location for a moment? \"Front beach line\" isn't just marketing speak &ndash; it means you could theoretically roll out of bed, stumble outside, and have your toes in Mediterranean sand before your coffee finishes brewing. Your morning commute becomes a beach walk. Your evening entertainment is watching the sunset paint the sky while waves provide the soundtrack.</p><h2>Interior Design &ndash; Classic Mediterranean with a Country Touch</h2><p>The overall design blends<strong>classic Mediterranean charm</strong>with subtle<strong>country-style elements</strong>. Light-colored furniture, cream-toned sofas, wooden textures, and a natural stone fireplace create a warm and inviting atmosphere. The interior palette leans on cream, beige, soft yellow, and olive green&mdash;colors that not only feel timeless but also harmonize with the coastal surroundings.</p><h3>Living Room &ndash; Comfort Framed by Views</h3><p>The living room is designed for both social gatherings and quiet relaxation. Chesterfield-style sofas with rounded arms and button tufting add a note of sophistication. Delicate floral motifs in the upholstery bring a touch of nostalgia without overpowering the space.</p><p>The seating is arranged in a U-shape by the windows, allowing everyone to enjoy conversation while gazing at the endless blue. In one corner, a stone-clad fireplace stands as both a focal point and a practical feature, perfect for cozy winter evenings.</p><p>Curtains combine light cream on the upper panels with olive green on the lower, paired with sheer drapes to frame the large windows and enhance the perception of height. Daylight streams in freely, while classic chandelier lighting offers a soft, ambient glow after sunset.</p><h3>Balconies and Terraces &ndash; Extending the Living Space</h3><p>Generous balconies open directly to the sea, providing the ideal setting for breakfast with the sunrise, leisurely afternoon reading, or sunset dinners. Rattan-style outdoor furniture adds natural texture, with pale yellow cushions that echo the indoor palette.</p><p>One balcony features a small built-in stone barbecue&mdash;an inviting spot for summer evenings with friends and family.</p><h3>Kitchen &ndash; Rustic Warmth with Everyday Functionality</h3><p>The kitchen embraces a warm, rustic style. Light cream cabinetry with framed doors and matte glass inserts pairs beautifully with a classic ceramic backsplash. A round glass dining table with bamboo chairs brings a casual, summer-home feel. The space is highly functional, offering plenty of storage and a relaxed breakfast area.</p><h3>Bedrooms &ndash; Calm and Minimal</h3><p>Bedrooms follow a minimalist approach for restful comfort. Neutral tones and uncluttered layouts allow for personalization. A few decorative updates&mdash;such as new artwork, bed linens, or accent rugs&mdash;could instantly infuse more character while keeping the peaceful vibe intact.</p><h2>Living Experience &ndash; A Home for All Seasons</h2><p>Owning this apartment means living with the sea as your constant backdrop. Mornings begin with coffee on the balcony as fishing boats pass by. Evenings can be spent hosting friends around the barbecue or watching the sunset from the living room.</p><p>In cooler months, the fireplace becomes the heart of the home, offering warmth while waves roll in outside. The interior&rsquo;s classic design ensures it never feels dated, while small modern touches could adapt it easily to personal taste.</p><h2>Location &ndash; Tosmur's Unique Coastal Charm (The Best Kept Secret of Alanya)</h2><p>Here's a little secret that real estate agents don't always shout about: while everyone's fighting over<a href=\"https://luxuryestateturkey.com/en/real-estate/turkey/alanya/center\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">properties in central Alanya</a>, the smart money has been quietly discovering Tosmur. Located just east of the main hustle and bustle, this serene coastal district is like finding a hidden gem that somehow escaped the tourist guidebook frenzy &ndash; and honestly, that's exactly what makes it so special.</p><p>The star of the show here? The magnificent<strong>Dim&ccedil;ay River</strong>, which isn't just another pretty water feature on your Instagram feed. Come summer, this becomes your personal oasis where the temperature drops a blessed few degrees, and suddenly you understand why locals have been keeping this place to themselves. Picture yourself dining at one of the charming riverside restaurants, your feet dangling in cool mountain water while you feast on fresh trout &ndash; yes, this is actually your neighborhood now, not just a weekend getaway.</p><p>But let's talk about those riverside restaurants for a moment, because they're not your typical tourist traps. These family-run establishments have been perfecting their recipes for generations, serving meals on platforms built right over the flowing water. The sound of the river becomes your dinner music, and the natural air conditioning means you can actually enjoy a hot meal without melting. Some places even have those traditional Turkish wooden platforms where you can lounge like royalty after lunch. And for the kids (or the young at heart), there are go-kart tracks that add just the right amount of adrenaline to your lazy river day.</p><p>Now, here's where Tosmur gets really clever about daily living. Forget about those suburban nightmares where you need a car to buy milk. Everything you need for everyday life is within an easy stroll &ndash; supermarkets that stock both Turkish essentials and international favorites, butchers who know their craft, greengrocers bursting with produce so fresh it was probably picked that morning. But the real treat? The bustling Thursday market that transforms the streets into a sensory adventure of fresh produce, warm b&ouml;rek straight from the oven, olives that taste like sunshine, and those random household items you didn't know you needed until you saw them at unbeatable prices.</p><p>The beauty of Tosmur's compact layout means you can literally walk everywhere without breaking a sweat (well, maybe a little sweat &ndash; it is the Mediterranean, after all). Your daily routine becomes a pleasant neighborhood stroll rather than a logistical challenge. But when you do want to venture beyond your peaceful bubble, public buses practically stop at your doorstep, whisking you off to explore other corners of Alanya. Fancy some shopping in Oba? Fifteen minutes. Want to check out the nightlife in Kestel? Twenty minutes. Feel like exploring the newer developments in Cikcilli? Half an hour max. You get the best of both worlds &ndash; tranquil residential living with the entire Alanya region as your extended backyard.</p><p>The dining scene here deserves its own love letter. Family-run restaurants where the grandmother still makes the bread by hand, serving authentic Turkish dishes that would make your Turkish friends nod in approval. But this isn't some isolated village &ndash; you'll also find eateries with European menus for those nights when you're craving something familiar. The best part? Prices that won't make your wallet weep, because you're living where locals eat, not where tour buses stop.</p><p>And for those days when you want to add a touch of adventure to your routine,<strong>Dim Cave</strong>awaits just a short drive up into the Taurus Mountains. This isn't just any cave &ndash; it's one of Turkey's largest public caves, a natural wonder that stays a cool 18&deg;C year-round. Imagine telling friends back home that your weekend plans include exploring underground cathedrals carved by nature over millions of years. The drive up is an adventure in itself, winding through pine forests and mountain villages where time seems to move at a more civilized pace.</p><p>What really sets Tosmur apart is this perfect balance it strikes. You're close enough to central Alanya to enjoy all the amenities and entertainment of a major resort town, yet far enough away to escape the crowds and noise when you want to. You get to live like a local while still having access to everything that made you fall in love with the Turkish Riviera in the first place. It's sophisticated without being pretentious, convenient without being commercial, and peaceful without being boring.</p><p>This is the kind of place where you'll find yourself becoming a regular at the local bakery, where the bus drivers wave when they see you, and where summer evenings are spent watching the sunset reflect off the river while planning which riverside restaurant to try next. Tosmur doesn't just offer you a place to live &ndash; it offers you a community, a lifestyle, and a daily dose of that particular Turkish warmth that makes every day feel just a little bit magical.</p><h2>Building and Community Features of the Residence</h2><p>This well-maintained beachfront complex offers:</p><ul><li><p><strong>24/7 camera security</strong>for peace of mind</p></li><li><p><strong>On-site caretaker</strong>ensuring daily maintenance</p></li><li><p><strong>Cable TV-satellite infrastructure</strong></p></li><li><p><strong>Open car park</strong>for residents</p></li><li><p>Direct<strong>front beach line access</strong></p></li><li><p>Location in an<strong>area open for residence permits</strong></p></li></ul><h2>Investment Potential &ndash; High Returns and Added Benefits</h2><p>Properties in Alanya with direct sea frontage are in high demand, both for holiday rentals and long-term stays. This apartment&rsquo;s size, location, and residence permit eligibility give it a competitive edge.</p><p>Fully furnished and move-in ready, it requires no additional investment to start generating rental income. The combination of Alanya Castle views and immediate beach access allows for premium rental rates, while the growing popularity of Tosmur ensures strong future appreciation.</p><h2>Your Trusted Partner &ndash; Luxury Estate Turkey</h2><p>Purchasing property abroad should be a secure and seamless experience.

    "property_description": "<div><h2>4 Room Apartment for Sale in Momentum Residence Alanya Center &ndash; Modern Family Living Near the Sea</h2><p>Some homes are built just for summer. Others, like this one in&nbsp;<strong>Momentum Residence</strong>, are designed for families who want to live in Alanya year-round. With 160 m&sup2; of space, four rooms, and a location just 500 meters from the sea, this apartment combines the size of a true family house with the convenience of being in the city center.</p><p>Built with modern materials and smart layouts, it feels more like a spacious city residence than a holiday flat. For buyers seeking comfort, practicality, and investment value, this property represents one of the strongest options in Alanya today.</p><h2>Living Room &ndash; Spacious and Inviting</h2><p>The living room makes an immediate impression with its sense of space. Light-colored marble-effect flooring and recessed spotlights brighten the area, while dark gray furniture with gold-detailed legs introduces a touch of elegance. The look is &ldquo;simple yet stylish&rdquo;&mdash;not overwhelming, but refined.</p><p>A modern wooden TV unit contrasts nicely with the gray-white tones of the room, adding warmth to the otherwise clean palette. The size of the living room is one of its biggest advantages: it easily accommodates large family gatherings, dinner parties, or evenings with friends.</p><h2>Kitchen &ndash; Functional and Modern</h2><p>The kitchen follows an L-shape design, finished in a timeless combination of white and anthracite cabinetry. The marble-pattern dining table pairs with dark velvet chairs, creating a stylish but practical setup.</p><p>For families who plan to live here year-round, the generous storage and workspace make daily cooking easier. The overall feel is modern, practical, and welcoming&mdash;a kitchen you will actually enjoy using every day.</p><h2>Bedrooms &ndash; Privacy and Comfort</h2><p>The&nbsp;<strong>master bedroom</strong>&nbsp;is designed for comfort. Large windows let in natural light, while curved curtain details and wooden accents create a warm, personal atmosphere. The space feels like a private retreat, complete with en-suite potential.</p><p>The second bedroom includes twin beds&mdash;ideal for children or guests. Its straightforward layout appeals especially to families, as it offers ready-to-use functionality. Additional rooms can serve as guest spaces, home offices, or even hobby rooms, depending on the buyer&rsquo;s needs.</p><h2>Balcony &ndash; Views of the City and Mountains</h2><p>The balcony is large and framed with black wrought-iron railings, adding a classic touch of elegance. The view stretches across both the city and the surrounding mountains, giving residents the best of both worlds.</p><p>During the day, it offers freshness and light. At night, city lights create a cozy backdrop for evening dinners or quiet conversations. In Alanya, balconies are often treated like second living rooms, and this one is more than capable of fulfilling that role.</p><h2>General Atmosphere</h2><p>The apartment as a whole embraces the style of a&nbsp;<strong>modern city home</strong>. Gray tones dominate the palette, giving it a serious, urban feel, but wooden accents soften the look and prevent coldness. Materials are chosen for durability, particularly the flooring and kitchen surfaces, ensuring long-term use.</p><p>This is not a holiday-only flat. It is a full-sized, fully functional apartment designed for everyday life.</p><h2>Facilities in Momentum Residence</h2><p>What makes Momentum Residence especially attractive is its wide range of social and leisure facilities, including:</p><ul><li><p>Outdoor and indoor swimming pools</p></li><li><p>Fitness center, sauna, steam room, and jacuzzi</p></li><li><p>Children&rsquo;s pool, playground, and dedicated kids&rsquo; rooms</p></li><li><p>Relaxing room and poolside bar</p></li><li><p>Barbecue pavilion and landscaped green areas</p></li><li><p>Lobby with caretaker and door security</p></li><li><p>24/7 camera surveillance</p></li><li><p>Open car park and generator</p></li></ul><p>The mix of family-friendly and wellness-focused features makes it equally suitable for long-term living and holiday rentals. Parents can enjoy the spa while children play safely, and everyone benefits from the community atmosphere.</p><h2>Who Will Love This Apartment?</h2><ul><li><p><strong>Large families</strong>: With 160 m&sup2; and four rooms, it provides the kind of space that is rare in central Alanya.</p></li><li><p><strong>Long-term residents</strong>: Its layout, storage, and facilities are built for everyday living, not just vacations.</p></li><li><p><strong>Investors</strong>: Located in the city center, close to the beach, with extensive amenities&mdash;it has all the hallmarks of high rental potential.</p></li></ul><p>In short, this apartment is not just about summer&mdash;it is about a lifestyle that works all year.</p><h2>Life in Alanya Center</h2><p>Living in Alanya&rsquo;s center means everything is close at hand. Streets are alive with caf&eacute;s, stylish coffee shops, fashion boutiques, and international restaurants. Global brands share space with local markets, creating a lively mix of modern and traditional.</p><p>Historic landmarks like the&nbsp;<strong>Red Tower</strong>,&nbsp;<strong>Alanya Castle</strong>, and the ancient shipyard are part of the daily landscape. Shopping is simple: from jewelry stores to electronics and cosmetics, every need is covered.</p><p>Public transport is frequent and convenient. The 101 bus runs along the coast, stopping at all major beaches, while the 202 lines connect to nearby districts like Oba and Tosmur. Taxis are available everywhere.

    "property_description": "<div><h2>Seafront 4 Room Apartment for Sale in Tosmur Alanya &ndash; Fully Furnished with Panoramic Views</h2><p class=\"whitespace-normal break-words\">If you've ever wanted to wake up to endless blue views, this place delivers exactly that. This 4-room<strong>beachfront<a href=\"https://luxuryestateturkey.com/en/real-estate/turkey/alanya/apartments\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">apartment in Alanya</a></strong>sits right on the Mediterranean coastline in Tosmur area, and it's semi-furnished and ready to go.</p><p class=\"whitespace-normal break-words\">The location really is the main selling point here. You're literally on the seafront with a south-west orientation, so you get both sunrise and sunset views. The main balcony has glass enclosure, which means you can enjoy those sea views even when it's not perfect weather outside. Plus, you get nice views of Alanya Castle and the surrounding mountains too.</p><p class=\"whitespace-normal break-words\">The apartment is 140 m&sup2; with an open-plan layout that feels quite spacious. The large format floor tiles help make everything look bright and airy. Since it comes fully furnished, you could basically move in with just your suitcase.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p class=\"whitespace-normal break-words\">Whether you're looking for a permanent home, somewhere for holidays, or an investment property, this ticks the boxes. The minimalist interior style is pretty adaptable if you want to change things up later.</p><h2>Interior Design &ndash; Modern Minimalist with Coastal Influence</h2><p>The apartment&rsquo;s design follows a<strong>modern minimalist style</strong>, with clean white walls, understated ceiling details, and concealed spot lighting that adds depth without clutter. Large beige ceramic floor tiles with a glossy finish give the space a contemporary feel while reflecting natural light throughout the day.</p><h3>Open-Plan Living with a View</h3><p>The<strong>American-style kitchen</strong>merges seamlessly with the living area, allowing you to enjoy sea views from almost every angle. This layout enhances social interaction&mdash;guests can relax in the lounge while you prepare meals without feeling disconnected. The kitchen itself features warm wood cabinetry paired with sleek black countertops. Upper cabinets include glass-fronted sections, perfect for displaying decorative items or storing everyday tableware within easy reach.</p><h3>Main Balcony &ndash; Your Front Row to the Mediterranean</h3><p>One of the apartment&rsquo;s standout features is the<strong>spacious glass-enclosed balcony</strong>facing the sea. The sliding panels can be fully opened during summer to let in the breeze or kept closed in cooler months to create a sheltered winter garden. From here, you can watch fishing boats in the morning, glowing sunsets in the evening, and the illuminated silhouette of Alanya Castle at night.</p><h3>Flexible and Bright Bedrooms</h3><p>The master bedroom offers direct balcony access and a wide-angle sea view&mdash;waking up here feels like staying in a boutique hotel every day. Currently, it is minimally furnished with a dark bed frame, leaving you the freedom to choose your preferred d&eacute;cor. Two additional rooms can serve as guest bedrooms, home offices, or walk-in wardrobes depending on your needs. Their versatility ensures the apartment adapts to different stages of life.</p><h3>Additional Balconies for Multiple Lifestyles</h3><p>While the main balcony captures the Mediterranean, the rear balconies overlook the Taurus Mountains and Alanya&rsquo;s cityscape. They make perfect spots for morning coffee, small herb gardens, or private reading corners.</p><h2>Ready for a Personal Touch &ndash; Furnished Yet Customizable</h2><p>Currently, the apartment is furnished with simple, functional pieces such as a white plastic outdoor dining set with blue-striped cushions&mdash;evoking a light coastal feel. However, it offers ample opportunity for style upgrades. Rattan or teak furniture could elevate the balcony into a true luxury outdoor lounge. Indoors, you could go for:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Modern Coastal:</strong>Whites, blues, and natural textures like linen and sisal.</p></li><li><p><strong>Contemporary Luxury:</strong>Glass, metal, and marble details with statement lighting.</p></li><li><p><strong>Rustic Mediterranean:</strong>Wooden furniture, warm textiles, and terracotta accents.</p></li></ul><p>The neutral color palette makes these transformations straightforward, ensuring your investment feels truly personal.</p><h2>Light and Orientation &ndash; Sunshine All Day</h2><p>Thanks to its<strong>south-west exposure</strong>, the apartment enjoys direct sunlight for most of the day. Morning light fills the bedrooms, while the living area and balcony glow in the golden afternoon sun. This orientation not only improves comfort but also reduces the need for artificial lighting, contributing to lower energy use.</p><h2>Complex Features &ndash; Full Comfort Right by the Sea</h2><p>The residence offers everything needed for year-round living:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Swimming Pool</strong>&ndash; Main and children&rsquo;s pools for cooling off in summer.</p></li><li><p><strong>Barbecue Area</strong>&ndash; Perfect for weekend gatherings.</p></li><li><p><strong>Green Spaces</strong>&ndash; Landscaped gardens creating a tranquil setting.</p></li><li><p><strong>Parking</strong>&ndash; Open car park with easy access.</p></li><li><p><strong>Security</strong>&ndash; 24/7 camera system and door security.</p></li><li><p><strong>Generator</strong>&ndash; Ensures uninterrupted electricity supply.</p></li><li><p><strong>Caretaker Services</strong>&ndash; On-site assistance for maintenance and daily needs.</p></li><li><p><strong>Direct Beach Access</strong>&ndash; Safe underpass leading straight to the shoreline.</p></li></ul><p>Moreover, the building&rsquo;s<strong>frontline beach position</strong>guarantees your view remains unobstructed for years to come&mdash;an important factor for both enjoyment and long-term value.</p><h2>Investment Potential for Investors</h2><p>Tosmur has grown into one of Alanya&rsquo;s most desirable residential areas, attracting both local and international buyers. Its combination of beachfront living, easy access to city amenities, and a welcoming community makes it a prime choice for investors.</p><ul><li><p><strong>High Rental Potential</strong>&ndash; South-west facing apartments with uninterrupted sea views are among the most requested by holiday renters.</p></li><li><p><strong>Resale Value</strong>&ndash; Limited supply of true seafront properties ensures stable appreciation.</p></li><li><p><strong>Flexible Use</strong>&ndash; Suitable for year-round residence, seasonal holidays, or income generation.</p></li></ul><h2>Tosmur &ndash; Nature, Convenience, and Culture in One District</h2><p>Located just east of Alanya&rsquo;s city center, Tosmur offers a rare balance between urban convenience and natural beauty. It is best known for the<strong>Dim&ccedil;ay River</strong>, a refreshing escape during the hot summer months. Families and friends gather at riverside restaurants, enjoy picnics under the shade of trees, or cool off in the icy mountain water. For those seeking more excitement, the nearby go-kart track adds a dose of adrenaline.</p><p>Daily life in Tosmur is effortless. Within walking distance, you will find:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Supermarkets</strong>&ndash; For all essentials.</p></li><li><p><strong>Butchers &amp; Greengrocers</strong>&ndash; Offering fresh, local produce.</p></li><li><p><strong>Thursday Market</strong>&ndash; A vibrant bazaar with fruit, vegetables, clothing, and household items&mdash;almost like a small version of Istanbul&rsquo;s Grand Bazaar.</p></li></ul><p>While the district is compact enough to navigate on foot,<strong>bus stops</strong>on almost every corner connect you quickly to neighboring areas such as<strong>Kestel, Oba, and Cikcilli</strong>, as well as Alanya&rsquo;s bustling center.</p><p>Dining options range from traditional Turkish family restaurants to international cuisine. The famous<strong>Dim Cave</strong>, one of Turkey&rsquo;s largest publicly accessible caves, is also nearby, adding a unique natural attraction to the area.</p><h2>Living Here &ndash; A Day in the Life</h2><p>Imagine starting your morning with a walk along the shoreline, greeting the day with the sound of waves. After breakfast on your balcony, you could stroll to the Thursday market to pick up fresh fruit, enjoy a riverside lunch at Dim&ccedil;ay, then return home for an afternoon swim in the pool. In the evening, the balcony becomes your private theater for the Mediterranean sunset, followed by a relaxing barbecue with friends.</p><p>This is the lifestyle Tosmur offers&mdash;one where daily needs, leisure, and nature blend seamlessly.</p><h2>Why Choose Luxury Estate Turkey as Your Trusted Partner?</h2><p>Buying property in another country can feel overwhelming, but with the right partner, it becomes an exciting and secure journey.
