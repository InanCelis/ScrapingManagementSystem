This glamorous southwest-oriented home boasts magnificent views, top-of-the-line qualities, and a feel of luxury &amp; comfort all around.</p><p>On the first level, we find an open-plan living area, bright and spacious, with raised ceilings that give this particular apartment a feeling of openness as you walk in. This duplex has beautiful Porcelanosa flooring throughout, and a well-equipped kitchen that features a gorgeous Silestone countertop, perfect for entertaining or enjoying a relaxing brunch. All ceiling lights throughout the house are energy efficient with invisible elements.</p><p>The living room is perfect for a cozy gathering. On this level, we find a guest bedroom with a bathroom.</p><p>The fantastic terrace spans the entire length of the floor and can be accessed from both the living room and kitchen. It fits a dining table, perfect for gatherings on a warm Andalusian summer evening, or a fun-filled family lunch. It is also a welcoming sitting area where one can enjoy a nice glass of wine, a relaxing conversation, and, of course, the fabulous views of the Mediterranean and the nearby hills. A little slice of paradise at home!</p><p>A sophisticated modern stairway leads us upstairs, where we find two more bedrooms, each with its en-suite bathroom. The master bedroom comes with ample built-in closets. On that same level, we see a second open terrace, ideal for sunbathing, as it is perfectly private, and where one can enjoy a snack while taking in the incredible views.</p><p>Back on the bottom floor, the laundry room is separated from the kitchen by a door, where there is space for storage (like a pantry), and we find a washing machine. All appliances are top-tier brands (Siemens). The apartment features a highly efficient aero-thermal system with a heat pump. There is Central cooling/heating throughout, with independent thermostats in the living room and bedrooms, and energy-efficient heated flooring in the master bedroom and en-suite bathroom.</p><p>The complex is modern, with clean lines and a lovely swimming pool area, where one can spend a relaxing morning or afternoon in the sun or under a tropical-style parasol. The gardens boast mature vegetation, like olive trees, that offer a lovely natural shade during the summer heat. Residents also have access to a clubhouse featuring a gym equipped with weights and other amenities, a lounging area ideal for parties and gatherings, a large TV for watching sports or movies, a fully equipped kitchen, a bathroom, and a lovely terrace with a dining table. The area is one of the safest in Marbella; still, the community is gated and has security cameras throughout the property.</p><p>Indoor Built Area: 133,65m&sup2;<br>Terraces: 53,35m&sup2;</p></div>",

The apartment has been renovated in a welcoming Scandinavian style that fulfils the greatest needs of most people who dream of a home in southern Spain. There are clean lines from floor to ceiling and a fantastic terrace where you can enjoy the many hours of sunshine the Costa del Sol has to offer.</p><p>As you enter the apartment, you'll be greeted by an abundance of light pouring in from floor-to-ceiling sliding doors that provide direct access to the inviting 45 square metre terrace. On the terrace, you can not only soak up the sun until late afternoon, but also enjoy the sun welcoming you in the morning as the golden morning light streams in through the windows. Rise to the warm rays of the sun with a morning coffee in hand and sit back as you enjoy the view of the calm Mediterranean Sea. In the evening, you'll notice how the light constantly changes on the mountains on the horizon and you'll realise that a mountain never looks the same throughout the day.</p><p>Inside the apartment you'll find two beautiful bathrooms that invite you to relax. Here you can take your time, because time is not a factor for you. Jump in the shower or soak in the bathtub and let time pass while you relax. In the kitchen, a social space awaits you that seamlessly connects the living room to the kitchen. While you cook, you can enjoy the view through the seamless windows where the view is like a painting.

With two bedrooms facing the terrace and a  bedroom on the opposite side, you have three large bedrooms so you can easily and conveniently invite the family over.</p><p>Outside the apartment, a beautiful green community with several swimming pools awaits you. In fact, you have a view of them from your terrace. Lie back in the afternoon or evening and soak up the sun, take a dip in the inviting water (which will cool you down a bit), and otherwise relax in stunning surroundings far away from any road noise.

The South East facing terrace is a great spot to look out at the boats in the marina, as well as the sea in the distance.</p><p>This property needs refurbishment, hence the price. There is also no allocated parking.</p><p>The property has a lift, and could be a very interesting buy to rent property.</p><p>Viewings must be managed carefully as the owners friends stay there with a child needing 24hr care. But we can share a video of how it truly is prior to viewing so as not to not disrupt the childs program.</p></div>",

Sea views, golf views over the Marbella club golf and lush nature characterize this plot of more than 6.000m2! This 24h high-level security domain, features purely exclusive villas a horse riding center, charming clubhouse and an 18-hole golf course with many natural undulations. This renowned 18 hole golf club has been around for over 70 years and is known as one of the best clubs in Spain. Marbella Club brings its people together in the clubhouse, where the excellent menu attracts many club members and residents every day. In short, this cozy atmosphere makes you feel right at home.</p><p>The architect with years of experience in this region, designed a masterpiece that feels practical and homely at the same time. The oasis of green is drawn in as the large floor tiles extend from inside to outside, and even into the 75m2 pool! This way, one creates a natural place of tranquility.</p><p>The villa includes 776m2 of indoor area and 357m2 of terraces, distributed over 3 floors, each with their own individuality!</p><p>Below are the bodega, exclusive garage for 5 cars, technical rooms, gym and 3 suites each with dressing room and bathroom.<br />From each room and the gym you can enjoy the view into the beautiful nature that we intentionally leave untouched. Deer walk through the 5000m2 wooded area which you can see from this floor on a regular basis.</p><p>Above we have the entrance hall with wardrobe, guest toilet, living space, dining-area, kitchen and 2nd kitchen. From each of these rooms one has a view over the crests of the forest to the sea, the golf and the beautiful mountain scenery. Because of its south orientation the villa with adjoining pool also enjoys the Mediterranean sun all day.<br />This part of the house includes 202m2 of interior space and 160m2 of terraces, as well as a 75m2 swimming pool, which overflows to three sides and where the water level is equal to the terraces.</p><p>Lastly, the upper level consists of the Master bed- &amp; bathroom, with an indoor area of 84m2 and adjoining 127m2 terraces. From these terraces you can enjoy your built-in Jacuzzi, semi-covered chill-out area through a built-in bioclimatic pergola.</p><p>On each floor, the glass windows are TRUE ‘floor-to-ceiling’ with minimalist aluminum partitions so that you maintain maximum integration between inside and outside, even with closed panels.</p><p>In recent years Marbella is known for its modern, white ‘blocky’ villas, which we want to stay away from as much as possible with this design, by providing the design with natural elements that in this way ‘blend’ with the natural environment around it. Especially since the villa is partly ‘pushed’ into the mountainside, integration with nature is extremely important.</p><p>Of course, this gem is being built by one of the most reputable contractors in Marbella, so the construction quality is absolutely guaranteed!</p><p>Located in the green area of Benahavís, but just far enough from the hustle and bustle, this is also your ideal zen location, where everything is still very accessible. 15km from Puerto Banús, 4km from Cancelada (the nearest village) and 13km from Estepona.</p><p>Contact us for more info!</p></div>",

This six-bedroom, five-bathroom masterpiece offers a unique combination of timeless design and cutting-edge technology, surrounded by lush gardens and sweeping views that speak directly to the soul.</p><p>The interior of Villa TrueLove is a curated expression of natural elements and fine craftsmanship. From the first master bedroom adorned in wood and stone to the open ensuite bathroom with an artisan sink and walk-in dressing room, every corner is designed to soothe and inspire. Just beyond lies the villa’s wellness zone - home to an eight-person sauna, full massage area, and an awe-inspiring 1,500-year-old granite bathtub basking in sunlight under a skylight. The living areas flow organically into the gardens, where a parquet and opaque glass floor gives the illusion of walking on water, anchored by a central bioethanol fireplace. The kitchen, a design showpiece, combines natural wood with stainless steel and a sculptural island built to entertain and impress.</p><p>Adjacent to the main living area is the second master suite, a space with high ceilings and soft LED ambiance, styled with mid-century character and an open-plan bathroom featuring a gilded basin and walk-in glass shower. Upstairs, a fully equipped gym offers panoramic mountain and garden views, allowing you to train in total peace. The lower level reveals a private world of comfort and utility, with a concrete-and-parquet utility room, two design-forward bedrooms with ambient lighting and organic materials, and a cinema room acoustically designed for immersive viewing, complete with bar and guest facilities.</p><p>Hidden within the lower floor is perhaps the villa’s most surprising feature - a fully equipped panic room designed to accommodate up to 12 people. Self-sufficient with its own kitchen, bathroom, dining area, and surveillance access, this secure space is a testament to the property’s dedication to comfort and safety under any circumstances.</p><p>Outside, the true heart of Villa TrueLove comes alive. The gardens are a sensory journey: soft hybrid grass underfoot, a meditative Japanese stone garden, sculpted olive trees, and a thriving fruit grove filled with tomatoes, bananas, avocados, and pomegranates. An ancient Bali temple sits quietly in the center of a koi pond, accessed via a wooden bridge and shaded by towering trees. The infinity pool stretches into the horizon with submerged loungers at one end and a serene Buddha statue at the other. Nearby, the guest house provides ultimate comfort with a kitchenette, bathroom, bedroom, and a dedicated chill-out area for visiting friends or family.</p><p>On the far side of the garden stands the villa’s symbolic guardian - &apos;Grandfather&apos;, a majestic 1,000-year-old Algarrobo tree whose slow, cyclical regeneration mirrors the villa’s message of peace, rebirth, and spiritual reconnection. The emblem of TrueLove is subtly echoed throughout the home, grounding its luxury in meaning and intention.</p><p>Villa TrueLove is equipped with state-of-the-art features including 42 solar panels, water tanks, a high-level security system, aerothermal technology, and a complete water purification system. This is not merely a home; it is a holistic experience designed to elevate the senses, still the mind, and enrich the soul.</p><p>From the moment you arrive, you are enveloped in silence, balance, and beauty. And while you may one day leave its gates, a part of you will remain - forever connected to the essence of Villa TrueLove.</p></div>",
