The bathrooms are especially impressive: think freestanding round white bathtubs with gold faucets, large marble tiles, floating vanities, and clever recessed lighting. The master bath has a classy glass partition and backlit mirrors that make the space feel modern but serene.</p><p>Overall, this place balances luxury, comfort, and privacy in a bustling Bangkok neighborhood&mdash;definitely worth seeing if you want something spacious with a great indoor-outdoor flow.</p>",

The living area is compact but thoughtfully arranged&mdash;you've got a small gray sofa and loveseat around a wooden round coffee table, which makes it a nice spot to relax or entertain a guest. The decorative candles and a book on the table add a subtle, homey touch.</p><h3>Bedroom and Storage</h3><p>The bedroom fits both a queen and a king-size bed (which is a bit unusual and suggests flexible sleeping options). The soft headboard and multiple pillows give a very inviting, comfortable vibe, while two warm bedside lamps keep things cozy at night. A large mirror on the wall and a partition with frosted glass help define the space without closing it off.</p><h3>Kitchen and Dining</h3><p>The modern kitchen stands out with white cabinetry and sleek integrated appliances&mdash;all backed by a striking black backsplash. It&rsquo;s compact but definitely practical. Right next to it is a dining table with four chairs and a nice pendant lighting setup, ready for anything from quick breakfasts to small dinner gatherings.</p><h3>Natural Light and Finishes</h3><p>One of the highlights is the large window with curtains and a cushioned window seat that&rsquo;s perfect for morning coffee or reading. The hardwood floors and recessed ceiling lights tie the whole space together with a clean, contemporary feel. Overall, the neutral and pastel tones with a colorful geometric accent wall keep the place feeling fresh and modern.</p><p>You&rsquo;ll probably spend most of your time here in the combination living/dining/kitchen area since it&rsquo;s well laid out and feels open despite the compact size. Being freehold in a desirable Watthana neighborhood adds to its appeal, especially if you want a practical, stylish base in Bangkok.</p>",

Three bedrooms and three bathrooms make it practical whether you&rsquo;ve got a family, need a guest room, or want a home office. The layout feels open, with the living and dining areas flowing naturally.</p><p>The living room is light and bright, thanks to neutral walls and light wood floors. The standout piece is this orange upholstered sofa, which adds a cozy pop of color, complemented by the round marble-top coffee tables and soft cushions. You&rsquo;ll probably spend most of your time here relaxing or entertaining.</p><p>The kitchen&rsquo;s open, clean, and modern with white cabinetry and black countertops. The warm wood backsplash adds just the right touch to keep it from feeling too sterile. It&rsquo;s set up well for cooking and casual dining &mdash; plus, there's a dining table with four bright orange chairs that echo the living room sofa, so the space feels pulled together rather than haphazard.</p><p>Bathrooms stick with the minimalist, modern look &mdash; beige tiles, black fixtures, and clever storage that keeps things clutter-free. The glass partition with a black frame adds character without closing off the space. Also, there&rsquo;s a one-car garage, which is a nice bonus for Phra Khanong Nuea.</p><p>Overall, it&rsquo;s a pet-friendly condo that balances clean, modern style with a warm, lived-in feel. If you&rsquo;re looking for a place that&rsquo;s move-in ready with thoughtful details and enough space to breathe in the city, this is worth a look.</p>",

The glass dining table with upholstered chairs makes for a cozy spot to enjoy meals.</p><h3>Comfort and Style in the Bedrooms</h3><p>The master bedroom is generous in size and feels calm with a padded accent wall behind the king-size bed and soft, neutral tones throughout. A walk-in closet with glass sliding doors keeps everything organized and there&rsquo;s a sleek vanity with backlit mirror if you like to get ready in comfort. The en-suite features a glass shower, rainfall showerhead, and a built-in bathtub, all designed to be both practical and modern.</p><p>Wood laminate floors throughout add warmth, and you'll find nice touches like elegant lighting fixtures, decorative plants, and reflective surfaces that help expand the space visually.

The high ceilings and floor-to-ceiling windows really open up the space and give you those panoramic views of the Bangkok skyline you hear about from Sathon.</p><h3>Layout and Features to Note</h3><p>Inside, you&rsquo;ve got a double door entrance that leads into this big, empty canvas. There are multiple structural columns here and there, so any renovation or fit-out will need to work around them, but that&rsquo;s part of what gives the place character. There&rsquo;s a balcony or ledge area you can access, plus a spacious rooftop terrace with glass safety railings&mdash;great for outdoor seating or entertaining with that amazing urban backdrop. Also, you can actually see some green spaces from here, which is a nice break for a high-rise spot.</p><p>With a potential 4 bedrooms and 5 bathrooms, plus 4 parking spaces, this freehold resale unit is perfect if you want to create a custom luxury home or an impressive executive condo right in the heart of Thung Mahamek. The white-painted walls and glass ceiling section add to the bright, airy feeling, making this a space you&rsquo;ll likely spend most of your time in once it&rsquo;s done right.</p>",

The master features a modern double bed dressed in dark gray bedding with textured blankets, flanked by artworks and a cozy nightstand setup.
