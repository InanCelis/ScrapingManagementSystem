The location enjoys a cooler microclimate than coastal Pafos with reduced humidity levels, due to its altitude and its natural environment. Despite its proximity to Pafos (a mere 5-minute drive to the town centre), the site enjoys a level of privacy and access to nature that is most often associated with more remote, mountainous locations. The residence is located to the northeast of Konia, and sits at an even higher altitude than the community. The residence enjoys direct and convenient access to neighbouring communities for local amenities such as bakeries, groceries, tavernas, and schools. The location also provides excellent access to the motorway directly from the roundabout at the entrance of Pafos. Therefore, it is easy to access the Paphos centre, the General Hospital, and the International Airport. There is a variety of activities to be enjoyed within a 10km radius. It consists of three levels, arranged to work with the topography for easy access, security, and sustainability. Its unique architecture is inspired by the site itself, and follows the architects&rsquo; aesthetic and environmental values to provide for a lifestyle that is at once luxurious and leisurely. The site is configured in such a way as to make the most of the sweeping views over Pafos, and at the same time utilise the topography and gradient to provide convenient and secure access. The placement of the residence allows a large garden to the front, and maintains a large part of the plot to the rear for additional landscaping to create a more private garden.</p><p>&nbsp;</p>",

The Sarides Bros Construction building company specializes in individual projects, has long-term experience and impeccable reputation among its clients as a diligent builder of quality housing.<br />Only high-quality materials are used in the construction process! During the construction of the house, without exaggeration, the most advanced building materials from the leading manufacturers of Germany, Japan and Italy were used.<br />Up to 90% savings on electricity due to the abundance of the solar energy! In order to optimize electricity costs as much as possible, the house is equipped with solar batteries of the latest generation capable of covering from 50% to 95% of electricity consumption thanks to solar energy, depending on the degree of load on the system&nbsp;<br />Up to 90% savings on water are now possible due to the use of a well ! On the territory of the residence, a 30-meter well was explored and put into operation, which, taking into account the land area, will allow to economize rather significant amount of funds due to, essentially, free water for irrigation.&nbsp;<br />Structural flaws of the building are excluded!

Hence follows the concept of interior design of the house, embodied in a combination of three valuable materials - marble, Iroko timber and precious sorts of limestone. In other words, the frame should match the diamond, and this is possible if they have the same nature!<br />The minimalism is in the heart of the house design, the idea that nothing should distract the residents of the house from contemplating the beauty of the surrounding nature - the banana plantations that separate the house from the coral lagoon and mountains that carefully guard it from winter wind and summer heat.<br />A more than two-hundred years old olive tree is called to emphasize the connection and combination of the surrounding natural Mediterranean environment with the residence in hi-tech style. The olive tree is the center of the winter garden and is located in such a way that it can be admired from almost all the points of the hallway and living room.<br />The Winter Garden was designed by George Hristo, a rising star in the field of landscape design, laureate of the European award among young designers. The garden space, in fact, is a part of the living room, the same marble is used in its structure as in the house floors, to say nothing of the designer light that stresses the stylish garden and creates the impression of a closed room.<br />The formwork of the building facade and the retaining walls of the backyard were made as per a special design technology: while concrete placement, the timber the texture of which had been printed for centuries in the walls, was used<br />The 20-meter long corridor of the second floor simulates picture gallery with the sea landscapes of Cyprus, painted by the brush of the famous artist Natalia Ioannou.<br />All built-in furniture has been designed by Vardas Studio designers and produced under their supervision by Andreas furniture, the leading factory of exclusive furniture.<br />Shower screens and mirrors have also been custom-made and have the brand name ALEZONE.The longest warranty on the island is provided for these items.<br />All porcelain sanitary ware in the house has been produced by the leading brand in its segment, Villeroy &amp; Boch Co.<br />All mixers and mechanisms in the house are from Grohe, the leading brand in its segment.<br />Built-in appliances in the kitchens of the 2017 model are presented by Mile Co., the leading brand in its segment.&nbsp;<br />The chlorine-free sports infinity pool with Jacuzzi is finished with an exclusive Syrian stone of a rare kind.<br />The light design in the house is embodied with 100% energy-saving LED luminaries from the Italian company Lumin Arte, a leader in the elite lighting segment. More than 150 light sources have been installed in the house.</p><p>the \"smart house\" system of the latest generation with the exclusive mobile application \"ALEZONE HOME\"</p><p>ADVANTAGES AND CHARACTERISTICS OF THE SYSTEM</p><p>The \"smart house\" system, installed in the Alezone residence, is built on the modern KNX platform manufactured in Germany and does not require server rooms that demand heavy expenditures for power and maintenance.<br />This equipment is that of a new generation, incorporating all the revolutionary discoveries of recent years in the field of information technologies, which, in conjunction with the sophisticated design of control panels and switches make the management of a large house simple and convenient.<br />Matrix Co. has developed the exclusive mobile application \"Alezone Home\", which, when installed on a mobile phone, allows not only to effect 100% management of the house using a mobile phone, but also to quickly change the configuration of such management according to the specific needs of the owner.<br />The infrastructure of this \"smart house\" system is analogous and in case of disconnection of the Internet the direct management of the house does not become vulnerable in any way.&nbsp;<br />The system integrates all the electrical segments of the house into a single network and provides the following options with a personal smartphone, tablet, or touch panels located in the house:<br />light control<br />video surveillance<br />fire alarm<br />heating system<br />air conditioning system<br />security system<br />garden irrigation system<br />Internet, Bluetooth, Wi-Fi&nbsp;<br />music and other media<br />door lock control<br />curtain management<br />fan control<br />control of any office equipment with wireless protocols, cookers, coffee makers, vacuum cleaners.<br />\"Alezone Home\" application stipulates a simple procedure for updating the software as new technologies and opportunities emerge, which makes this smart home system perpetually relevant.</p><p>Allows to save up to 1 million euros on purchase of the project and opens great opportunities for using the residence for business purposes.</p><p>&nbsp;Alezone sea residence has been registered with a Cypriot company of the same name (\"ALEZONE ltd\") that is entitled to use this property, including for commercial purposes primarily, for rent.

A specially positioned information board will show a flora and fauna map of Cyprus.
