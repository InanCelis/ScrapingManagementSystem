In Marvila, we find new life among the refurbishment of its warehouses and a youthful atmosphere under constant growth. Here, art flourishes in art galleries, restaurants and numerous cultural spaces and the future smiles at us from the riverside, where we encounter other projects related to technology, innovation, entrepreneurship and creativity. It is this emerging revitalization that is transforming Marvila into Lisbon’s new cultural centre.Surrounded by excellent transport accesses and set in the main axis of Lisbon’s urban expansion, this is a prime location between the city centre and Parque das Nações.With the airport just five minutes away and the city centre at a distance of eight minutes, this is a superb address for those seeking easy and quality access, while enjoying all the peacefulness of life alongside the River Tagus.Alba is much more than just a luxury residential complex.

Thus, it combines contemporary design, but with continuity in time, while writing a new chapter of the beach chalet culture, which defined the architectural heritage nature of the Estoril and Cascais area.   Located in Estoril, between Cascais, Sintra and Lisbon, the The Frame gated community breathes in the sea air while benefiting from its proximity to the city. This development offers an unquestionable quality of life, benefiting from everything that the Cascais coastline promotes, namely the beach and golf, historic villages and a vibrant cultural life. Living in The Frame is living next to iconic places in one of the most influential areas of the coastline, such as Poça beach, Tamariz Oceanic Swimming Pool, Estoril Garden and Estoril Casino, Garret pastry shop, and the InterContinental Cascais.This development is for all those looking for the aesthetic meaning in everyday life, the perfect address for those who see life in an original manner, near everything but with their feet in the sea.",
