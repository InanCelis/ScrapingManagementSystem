    "property_description": "Description of object:\nFor sea lovers and connoisseurs of breathtaking sunsets!\n\nAccess to your new house is directly from the street. There is a private courtyard enclosed by fences. The entrance to the residential building is designed for two cars. Climbing vegetation covers pergolas over the parking areas and along the fences that separate the courtyards.\n\nThe area of the three-story building is 218.1 m².\n\nBehind the building, there are two parking spaces, a landscaped driveway, and an entry platform with bicycle parking spaces.  \nOn the first floor, there is an entrance hall with a staircase to the second floor and a storage room underneath, a storage room, a private bathroom, a kitchenette with a dining area, and a living room.\n\nThe veranda with the pool, an open area for sun loungers, and a barbecue area available as relaxation zones are located in the courtyard overlooking the sea.\n\nOn the second floor, there is a staircase and a corridor leading to two bedrooms, each with its own bathroom and wardrobe, as well as a balcony. One of the bedrooms offers panoramic views of the sea.\n\nThe third floor features a corridor with two bedrooms, each with its own bathroom and terraces; one of these terraces is a large panoramic terrace with sea views.\n\nYour new property at a glance:\n\n- Living area of 218 sqm,\n- 4 bedrooms,\n- 4 bathrooms with toilets,\n- 3 terraces,\n- Dressing room,\n- Kitchen with dining area,\n- Living room,\n- Outdoor pool,\n- 2 parking spaces,\n- Unique sunsets.\n\nThe house is offered turnkey with Act 16 approval.\n\nFixture and fittings:\nThe developer team consists of highly qualified contractors and experts in the field of construction. The developer is certified according to the occupational health and safety system OHSAS 18001:2007, the quality management system ISO 9001:2015, and the environmental management system ISO 14001:2015.\n\nDuring construction, only high-quality and modern materials and technologies are used, which are approved according to European standards.\n\nLocation:\nYour new house is located in a new complex near the coast, in the Kraimorie residential area, which belongs to Burgas. With a total built-up area of 2,936 m², the complex features 14 single-family houses, whose perfect location makes them an ideal choice for a summer house by the sea in Burgas or for year-round living.\n\nNear the complex, there are a school, a kindergarten, restaurants, and public transport stops. The houses are two-story and three-story buildings, each with its own separate garage or parking space with a capacity for two cars. On the ground floor of each house, there is a living room and a kitchen with a dining area, separated into corners, as well as a storage room and a bathroom with an entrance hall. Parking spaces are available in the southwestern enclosed courtyard.  \nThe courtyard where the house's pool is located is beautifully designed in tones that match the overall vision of the buildings.\n\nThe landscaping is natural—climbing vegetation on pergolas over the parking areas and on fences that separate the courtyards.
