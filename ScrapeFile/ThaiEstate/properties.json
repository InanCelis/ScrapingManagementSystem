    "property_title": "8 Atelier Residence – Boutique Luxury Condo in Phuket",
    "property_description": "Nestled in the tranquil yet up-and-coming Pasak Soi 8, Cherngtalay (Bang Tao area), 8 Atelier Residence offers a peaceful retreat just minutes from Bang Tao Beach, Boat Avenue, Porto de Phuket, and Laguna Golf Club. This low-density, villa-style condo enclave benefits from excellent connectivity and proximity to international schools, medical centres, upscale retail, and emerging infrastructure such as the planned LRT, medical hub, and entertainment zones—making it a premium choice for lifestyle or investment buyers. Project Overview Developed by Glam Estate Group, this boutique development comprises just 48 fully-furnished residences, ranging from 1-bedroom (≈51.8 sqm) to 3-bedroom units (up to ≈122.7 sqm), with a luxurious 276 sqm penthouse topping the property. Construction is set to begin in Q3 2025, with delivery targeted for Q1 2027. Design &amp; Interiors The residences are crafted in collaboration with Phuket’s 88 My Space studio, embracing a curated Indo‑Chine design language. Expect warm tonal palettes, chevron‑pattern wood flooring, recessed gold-accented ceilings, and bespoke furniture that exude elegance and enduring style. Resort-Style Amenities 45 m swimming pool Rooftop garden Full-size gym Sauna &amp; steam rooms Co‑working and co‑dining spaces, plus private meeting rooms 24-hour security, CCTV, concierge service Private parking: 49 cars, 19 motorcycles Pet-friendly floors available—rare in luxe Phuket developments Pricing &amp; Value &gt;&gt;&gt; PROMOTION UNTIL END OF AUGUST: 10% OFF THE LIST PRICE Early pricing starts from ≈5.6 million ฿ for 1‑bedroom units, with an average ≈110,000 ฿/sqm—roughly 32% below Cherngtalay’s current market average for new launches (~144,000 ฿/sqm). All prices include the full furniture package. Investment PotentialWith Phuket’s condo prices climbing ~14% overall, and Cherngtalay specifically up 18.8% CAGR, the case for capital appreciation is strong. Simultaneously, rental yields of 9–10% in nearby premium areas like Bang Tao and Laguna make this position attractive for yield-focused investors. Large-scale developments—including a ฿300B integrated resort &amp; casino, Phuket International Medical Hub, and major transport upgrades—further reinforce long-term growth prospects for the region. ✅ Why 8 Atelier Residence Stands Out FeatureBenefitUltra-low density (48 units)Privacy of a high-end villa with condo convenienceFully furnished, high-end designMove-in ready, elevated aestheticsResort-caliber amenitiesLifestyle experience just steps from your doorStrategic locationPeaceful yet close to beaches, leisure, education, and medical hubsCompetitive pricingSignificant value gap versus comparable resortsStrong investment thesisCapital growth + market-leading rental yield potential Don’t miss this rare opportunity to own a beautifully crafted residence at 8 Atelier – where timeless design, resort-style living, and strong investment potential come together in one of Phuket’s most desirable locations.",
