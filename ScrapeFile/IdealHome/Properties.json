Set on a 75 m² plot with a private gross area of 110.75 m², the property has undergone a complete transformation by a highly regarded interior architect, who created a modern and elegant home while maximising space and natural light. Just a short 10-minute drive from the stunning beaches of Albufeira, such as Praia dos Salgados and Praia da Galé, and only five minutes from the Algarve Shopping Centre, which offers a variety of shops, restaurants, cinemas, and supermarkets, the property is ideally situated for both permanent living and holiday rental potential.\n\nGuia is famously known as the birthplace of Portugals iconic Frango Piri-Piri, or spicy grilled chicken, and is home to numerous traditional restaurants that draw visitors from across the Algarve and beyond. This unbeatable location adds strong rental appeal for investors and an authentic lifestyle for residents.\n\nThe property is currently divided into two fully independent apartments, each with a private entrance. The main apartment features an open-plan kitchen that is fully fitted with modern appliances and seamlessly connects with a bright and stylish living and dining area. On the ground floor, there is a spacious ensuite bedroom, while the first floor is dedicated to the master suite, which offers direct access to a large private balcony with excellent sun exposure, equipped with outdoor furniture perfect for relaxing. From the living area, there is also access to a beautifully designed interior patio, ideal for al fresco dining, with a barbecue area, sofas, and a dining table. This unit is fully air-conditioned with new, high-efficiency units and benefits from solar panel water heating, ensuring energy efficiency and lower operating costs. The home is equipped with high-end double-glazed windows and electric shutters for optimal insulation and comfort.\n\nThe second apartment, also fully renovated and modern, includes an open-plan kitchen, dining, and living area that opens onto its own private patio, also designed for outdoor dining and lounging, complete with a barbecue setup. A bathroom is located on the ground floor, while an elegant staircase leads to the large upstairs ensuite bedroom, which is flooded with natural light and features a built-in wardrobe and a modern bathroom with a bathtub. This unit offers the same attention to detail, including quality finishes, electric shutters, double-glazed windows, and tasteful décor.\n\nThe property also offers private parking with the possibility of installing an electric vehicle charging station, further enhancing its appeal for sustainable living.
